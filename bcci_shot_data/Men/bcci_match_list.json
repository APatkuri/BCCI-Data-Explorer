        "PreMatchCommentary": "Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the second test match between India and South Africa at the Wanderers, Johannesburg. Wanderers have been a happy hunting ground for team India which has never lost a test match in this venue. Out of the five matches that have happened in this venue between India and South Africa, India has won two games and has drawn the remaining three games. Historically, the pitch suits the seamers who have bagged 93% of the wickets in this venue. Teams are expected to go in with a pace heavy attack. In the last 5 test matches that have happened here, the team batting first has won 4 times and the team batting second has won only once. The team winning the toss will most probably decide to bat first. Virat Kohli averages 77.5 in four innings in this venue which is the highest amongst all Indians but unfortunately, he misses out in today's game because of an upper back spasm. KL Rahul makes his debut as India's Test captain in the absence of Virat Kohli. INDIA HAS WON THE TOSS AND THEY WILL BAT FIRST.\n\nIndia (Playing XI): KL Rahul(c), Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant(w), Ravichandran Ashwin, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj.\n\nSouth Africa (Playing XI): Dean Elgar(c), Aiden Markram, Keegan Petersen, Rassie van der Dussen, Temba Bavuma, Kyle Verreynne(w), Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj, Duanne Olivier, Lungi Ngidi",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "That's it from this test then. South Africa level the Test series and have started the year on a high. Since 2013 all Test matches at The Wanderers have produced a result. Onto the decider now at Cape Town on the 11th of January. See you then!\n\n",

The series is poised at 1-1 after India comprehensively won the opening test at Centurion, while the Proteas fought back and levelled the series at the Wanderers, a match in which the result could have gone either way. History-hunting India will look for a first test series win in South African soil and a maiden test win at the picturesque Cape Town.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Virat Kohli is back for the Newlands test after an upper back spasm kept the Indian skipper out of the second game, and the pace attack will see a shuffle with Kohli confirming that Mohammed Siraj was unfit after picking up an injury at Wanderers.

        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>Handshakes all around, and credit to both sides for a terrific series across the 3 tests! It began with K L Rahul's century at Centurion, while Dean Elgar led from the front at Johannesburg to level the series. Newlands was a fascinating series decider as both sides went tooth and nail, but it was the hosts who came out on top with a splendid series win. Rishabh Pant scored a magnificent century for India to set the hosts a target of 212. India went into Day 4 boosted by the wicket of the South African skipper in the final ball of Day 3, but the bowling attack was thwarted by the partnership between Keegan Petersen and Rassie van der Dussen that primarily steered the chase, with Temba Bavuma providing the finishing touches.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli, India Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">It's a great spectacle of Tests for everyone to watch, it was a hard fought series. Great first game but South Africa did amazingly well. In both Tests they won, they were clinical with the ball in crunch moments.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">They applied pressure long enough for us to make mistakes. It's the understanding of conditions for them. The batting has to be looked into, no running away from that.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">Obviously very disappointed, we know how far we have come as a team. That fact that people expect us to beat South Africa in South Africa is testimony to how far we've come. We haven't done it, that's the reality, accept it and come back as better cricketers. Got to credit the opposition where due.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">I think the way K L Rahul batted as an opener was heartening, Mayank got stuck in on a couple of occasions, bowling was outstanding, few crucial knocks from the guys in the middle period, Rishabh Pant's knock in this Test was special, obviously Centurion win was special too. Take the positives and move ahead.\"</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Dean Elgar, South Africa Captain:&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>\"</strong>I am pr<span style=\"color:#222222\">etty elated. Obviously will sink in a day or two, maybe this evening.</span><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">Cannot be prouder of the group.</span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">If you want to operate at a high performance level, have to have tough chats.&nbsp;</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#222222\">If you want to compete in Test cricket and be no.1 someday, you have to beat the best in the world. I'm really happy that things went well for us.</span><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#222222\">We are by no means a finished article, I can tell you that. I'm already thinking of the next series.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">Keegan Petersen has dominated domestic cricket, great to see him have a great series.</span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">Even though he's someone older, he's willing to learn. He's a proper character within that team environment. Proud of what he has achieved.\"</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Keegan Petersen is named <strong>man of the match and man of the series</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Keegan Petersen</strong>:<strong> \" </strong>Don't know how I feel, it has not sunk in yet.&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#222222\">It's a mixed bag to be honest. Happy, emotional.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#222222\">It has been challenging surfaces, challenging bowling attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">It's been a long journey.</span><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;We knew it was going to be difficult, they are a high quality bowling attack, a high quality team.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">Just spending time at the wicket is crucial. Evident longer you bat, easier it gets. I enjoyed every moment of it.\"</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">The One Day Series starts on the 19th of January.

India go in unchanged, while Sisanda Magala comes in for Marco Jansen for the hosts.</p><p><strong>KL Rahul: \" I think it's pretty straightforward, second game on the same strip and it is important to put runs on the board. We are guessing the wicket will get slower later on.\"</strong></p><p><strong>Temba Bavuma: \"</strong><strong>We probably wanted to bat first.

In response, Janneman Malan and Quinton de Kock shared a century stand for the opening wicket, while Rassie van der Dussen and Aiden Markram finished the game with 11 deliveries to spare as South Africa go 2-0 up in the 3-game series.

Obviously not great to be on the losing side two games in a row.&nbsp;We are a team that takes a lot of pride in winning, but good learning for us and hopefully we can grow.&nbsp;Credit to them, they are showing us the importance of partnerships and putting pressure early on. (On positives so far) The way Virat and Shikhar batted in the first game. The way Rishabh batted today. It is not easy to come in with two down. He is a really important member of the team. Shardul has been hitting the ball well at the end. Jasprit Bumrah is obviously phenonemenal.\"</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Temba Bavuma, South Africa Captain</strong></span>: \"Very happy. That was the objective for us starting the series, we wanted to win it. Lot of positives to take from our performances. Spinners have done a splendid job. It's a great thing. We pride ourselves on fast bowlers, but to see the spin bowlers winning the game for us that really makes us a side to be reckoned with.\"</p><p><strong>Quinton de Kock, Player of the Match</strong>: \"It was nice to be out there and score couple of runs,&nbsp; I think me and Janneman Malan are both similar and have a great understanding.

After opting to bowl first, spin duo Yuzvendra Chahal and Washington Sundar did most of the damage with the ball, scalping 7-wickets between them to restrict West Indies to 176. Rohit Sharma top scored in the chase with 60, before debutant Deepak Hooda and Suryakumar Yadav's unbeaten half-century stand guided the hosts to victory.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Kieron Pollard, Captain, West Indies</strong></span>: \"Losing with 22 overs to spare is not ideal, it is a heavy defeat . Have to take stock of that. Getting four wickets there shows if we put some runs we can compete. Toss is also a crucial factor, it is very wet out there now. The lower-order batting from Jason Holder and Fabian Allen, Alzarri Joseph and Akeal Hosein did the work for us with the ball - those were the positives from today. \"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, Captain, India:</span></strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> </span>\"We want to keep getting better as a team it was a great effort from everyone. We ticked all the boxes. I'm open to a lot of things if we need to change. The goal is we should be able to achieve whatever the team wants. But, honestly, I don't think we need to change a whole lot. All I will ask of the players is to challenge yourself. I have been out for a while, haven't played for two months but I was back home hitting the balls. I knew there was a long season ahead. Had a good net session here and I was confident going into this game. Can take a lot of positives from today, the pitch had something in it. There was softness early on and in this particular game, the toss became important.&nbsp; I honestly want to take it away from the play, but if you win the toss, you take advantage of it.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Yuzvendra Chahal is the Man of the Match for figures of 4/49!&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Yuzvendra Chahal: </strong></span>\"Washington struck twice in an over, so the pressure was on them. and I just wanted to maintain that pressure.

West Indies started off well with the ball, but the partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and KL Rahul brought India back into the game. Further contributions from Sundar and Hooda took India to 237. With the ball, Krishna was the standout bowler, taking 4-12 from 9 overs. He also had support from Chahal, Thakur, Sundar, and Hooda who were amongst the wickets.</p><p><strong>Post Match Presentation:</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nicholas Pooran, West Indies captain:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">&nbsp;\"We let it slip with the bat.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">We weren't able to put up partnerships, we kept losing wickets. The more cricket we play together, hopefully, it will help us as batters. Odean is special. He is a strong guy, runs in can bowl 145. He is still young. With experience, the sky is the limit for him.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India captain:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2b2c2d\">\"Winning the series is a good feeling without a doubt. There were some challenges that we had to face today. That partnership between KL and Suryakumar Yadav. That is the maturity we need. We got to a respectable total, which was important. With the ball we were outstanding. The entire unit came together and performed together as a unit. It is important for these guys to bat in those kind of situations. That is when you can judge them. Today's knock will give Surya a lot of confidence. The pitch was not easy. So he batted and did what the team wanted and not what he wants to do. KL too, and that little innings from Hooda in the end. I have been asked to do different things, so this was different. People will be happy seeing Rishabh open then, but yeah it is not permanent. We will get Shikhar back next game, and he need some game time. It is not always the results. We want to try a few things with the long term in the mind so we don't mind if we lose the odd game in the process. I was a little surprised to not see the dew but again I am not taking anything away from the bowling unit. I have not seen that kind of spell in a long long time in India. He bowled with skill, he bowled with pace. All in all a great bowling effort.\"</span></p><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Prasidh Krishna, Player of the Match:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#000000\">\"I have been striving to do this for quite some time now, so I am happy it came off and we won the match. Nothing special, I was just looking to hit the good areas. Even when I went to bat it was still seaming so I knew there was something in it for me when we bowled. I wanted to keep it tight, keep it simple, and let the ball do the talking. Be as consistent as possible, bowl straighter lines, bowl good lengths.\"</span></div>",

        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>India wins by 96 runs and beats West Indies 3-0 for the first time in ODI's! India managed to score a competitive total of 265, largely due to contributions from Iyer, Pant, Chahar and Sundar. India was also clinical with the ball, with Prasidh Krishna being the pick of the bowlers again with 3-27.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>West Indies captain, Nicholas Pooran:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#000000\">\"Wonderful opportunity. Must say congratulations to Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid, first white ball series victory for them. The way we bowled in the series was wonderful. We have a lot of work to do with bowling and batting, more so batting this series. The way the boys bowled was fantastic. It seems like we are better at the shorter format, but we need to put in work in the longer format.\"</span></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Player of the Match, Shreyas Iyer</span>:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#000000\">\"To be honest, life was really tough for me last two months. Had an infection and Covid, but this day has summed up for all those days. I am flexible to bat anywhere but number 4 is the best number to bat at. If I am thrown into a pressure situation like today, I like to thrive on it and enjoy those moments. When I go in, like today's situation, I had to play off the new ball. For that, you need to have good skills and play close to the body. From there you need to set the rhythm through the innings. It's not easy, but if you focus on your skills you can do it.\"</span></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Player of the Series, Prasidh Krishna</span><span style=\"color:#000000\">: </span></strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">\"Now that I've been practicing and played a few Vijay Hazare matches I have a few overs in me and am in rhythm. Anything going to the keeper or the slips, I like that kind of wickets. Today both wickets I got, it was quite nice to see the ball get the carry and good to have people behind who won't miss out when you create an opportunity. When you are running in and see the ball flying to the keeper, it's what any fast bowler wants. The kind of guys we have in the team, everybody is good and we've been learning from each other. Anybody who turns up can do very well - that's the team effort. Still being grounded that way, it's a team effort. If we look at the three games, we batted quite well even though the wicket had something.\"</span></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India captain, Rohit Sharma</span>:<span style=\"color:#000000\"> </span></strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">\"Definitely not looking at those numbers (captaincy record). Have ticked a lot of boxes in this series. Whatever we wanted to get out of this series, we pretty much got. Noise will be around as long as we're playing. People look up to us, everybody watches us. As players, as individuals, we know what we need to focus on. Outside noise doesn't bother the dressing room. Said it in the last game as well - never seen something like that in India (Prasidh's spell). Good to have someone who can hit the deck and get that bounce. Although I didn't feel like this was Indian conditions, was good to see the fast bowlers actually. Was also impressed with Siraj. And then Shardul and Deepak did the job for us. Both Kuldeep and Chahal are crucial players for us. Especially Kuldeep. Chahal was very much in the plans and Kuldeep went off the radar. It was important to get him back slowly. Important to give them that confidence. We start expecting things early than expected, important to give them some cushion. Pretty sure we'll see them together soon. That was the biggest takeway for us - the middle-order batting. Today was again a great game for the middle order. We were 40/3. For me, that's the biggest takeaway.\"</span></p>",

He's got a bright future and it's just about us now on how we use him.

He and Pooran almost took us over the line. Pleased with the guys. They have quality bowlers, you have to give credit where it's due. In the first game you could have said we were a bit slow in the middle overs but we corrected that here. We can look at it in different ways how we could have got those eight runs. We are a work in progress.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain</strong></span>: \"You are always a bit scared when you are playing against these guys. In the end it was a phenomenal game. Right from the start we knew it wouldn't be easy, but it was great how we executed our plans under pressure. It was very critical at that point when Bhuvneshwar bowled. That's where experience comes into play, he has been doing it for many years. The way Virat started he took the pressure off me as well. It was a very important innings. And great finish by Rishabh and Venky Iyer. To see that sort of maturity from Iyer is very pleasing. He looks confident and towards the end he asked me if I wanted to give him an over.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Rishabh Pant is the player of the match</strong></p><p><strong>Rishabh Pant</strong>: \"I am fine wherever the team wants me to bat. I think the more you practice, the better you get (on his scoop).&nbsp; The only thing we were talking was that we will play according to every ball. He (Powell) was hitting bullets. At the back of my mind I was happy as well as Powell will be playing for Delhi Capitals, but we are playing for India now and we have to win every game.\"</p>",

After being put into bat, Ishan Kishan and Rohit Sharma got India off to a solid start with a century stand for the opening wicket, with the former going on to score 89, with 10 fours and 3 sixes. Shreyas Iyer took forward the momentum with a brisk half-century as India posted a mammoth 199/2 in 20 overs. Bhuvneshwar Kumar then got India off to a flying start with the ball, striking with the first ball, and Sri Lanka never really got going in their chase, with Charith Asalanka's 53 being the highlight of their innings. Chamika Karunaratne provided some big hits towards the end as Sri Lanka posted 137 on the board.</p><p><br /><strong>Dasun Shanaka, Captain, Sri Lanka</strong>: \"We were really poor in all 3 departments, they batted beautifully and read the game very well. We are without our main spinners, Theekshana and Hasaranga, the replacements have not got the experience yet. Hope Asalanka carries forward in the next game and makes it count. Chamika Karunaratne is bowling beautifully, situation did not allow me to bowl long, he's our main strike bowler.\"</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Captain, India</strong></span>; \"I know the mindset and ability of Ishan Kishan, just about getting the knock he played today, getting the rhythm, he constructed his innings very well, especially after 6 overs, he likes to play his shots. Very happy with Jadeja's comeback. We want more from him, I want him to bat up the order, we have seen in the last few years how improved he is in his batting especially, we want to use that. We are very clear in what we want to achieve with him in limited-overs. I love playing on big grounds, you are tested as a batsman, your mindset, here you got to use batsmanship you have to try and see areas you have to attack. We had a brief chat on how we want to approach this ground. It's something that's happening, quite consistently, it's not expected at this level. Our fielding coach has some work to do, it's something we want to keep improving and come Australia, we want to be the best fielding side, can't afford to make mistakes.\"</p><p><strong>Ishan Kishan is named the Player of the Match</strong></p><p>Ishan Kishan: \"I got to learn from the last 3 games against West Indies, I didn't have that much intent. I wasn't that positive. Here I tried to keep it simple and what the team wanted. I think pull is my favourite and I really enjoyed that shot today. We have seen their videos and they love bowling short and heading into the World Cup, we know we need to get used to grounds like this, hitting the gaps and taking the ones and twos. Spoke to Shreyas about the mid wicket region and it went my way today.\"</p>",

Shreyas capped off a memorable series, anchoring the chase with an unbeaten 73, notching up his third consecutive half-century. India recorded their 12th consecutive win in T20I, as they record their third consecutive 3-0 T20I series win at home. After opting to bat first, Sri Lanka's batting was rattled as Avesh Khan and Mohammed Siraj scalped 3 early wickets to leave the visitors stranded at 29/4. Skipper Dasun Shanaka then played an excellent knock of 74 to lift them to 146/5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:#4e5f70\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, Captain, Sri Lanka</strong></span>: \"I want to congratulate India for a wonderful series. Hopefully not a bad injury, it's an open one, need to put stitches on this. Tough tour, without our senior bowlers it has been tough, we should adapt to the condition. In the first 6 overs again the batsmen didn't capitalize. The pace attack was outstanding throughout, and over the last year. It's not about pace, it's about control, I am very much happy about my form, hopefully I can continue. This is international cricket, when it comes to cricket we need to adapt.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Shreyas Iyer is named the Player of the Match and Player of the Series.</strong></p><p><strong>Shreyas Iyer:</strong>&nbsp; \"All 3 knocks were special, yesterday one we won the series, came at a crucial time, helped the team win, so maybe the last one was the most special. You only require one ball to get into the form as long as you keep your eyes on the ball and play the ball on merit. The wicket was two-paced today compared to yesterday, wanted to dominate as well, wanted to punish the loose balls, just have to back your instincts. It's been a roller-coaster journey after injury. The Rehab phase was a real test, I am really glad I got through that phase.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Captain, India:</strong></span> \"Yeah, it's a factor of everything that comes together, we did it collectively as a team. A lot of positives came out of the series, happy where we stand at the moment. Individuals want to do well, wanted to understand our bench strength also, wanted to give opportunities and they did well. I wouldn't completely agree (we are a conservative T20 side), we do understand at times we have held back ourselves. It is important to tell guys not to worry about their position in the team, you are here to do the job, doesn't mean you always have to score runs and take wickets. Trying to fill whatever gaps we have and we want to move forward.&nbsp;Going to be a big challenge, nice to have guys in former rather than not in form. Always nice to see guys make opportunities count. You move from strength to strength.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

Jadeja top-scored with the bat and remained unbeaten for India before shining with the ball again, picking up 9 wickets in the match. The second test of the series is a Day/Night game at Bangalore starting on the 12th of March. Join us then!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Dimuth Karunaratne, Sri Lanka captain:</strong></span> We never thought it would finish by day three. The batters need to put their hands up and bat longer innings. When you are playing against India you have to capitalize on the starts, once you get in you have to score big. We were too defensive or too aggressive with the bat, need to get a balance between both by rotating the strike and that's how you play big innings. As a batting unit, we have to put our hands up and score big. We did well for the first two sessions but could not execute when the ball got old and those are things we need to work on.<br /><br /><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India captain:</strong></span> It was a good start, it was a great game of cricket from our perspective. We ticked all the boxes we wanted to. To be honest I didn't think it is going to be that kind of a Test match that would get over in three days. It was a good batting pitch, there was some turn and some assistance for the seamers as well. A lot of credit to the guys, they bowled very well in tandem, kept the pressure, and never made it easier for the Sri Lanka batsmen. We just ensured we applied pressure from both ends. The highlight of the game was Jadeja. There was a question of whether to declare or not, it was the team's decision, Jadeja's decision to put them in, and shows how selfless he is. It will be our third pink-ball Test we will be playing at home and not many have played, it will be a challenge. Let's see what kind of pitch we are playing and then take it from there.<br /><br /><strong>Ravindra Jadeja is the Player of the match!<br /><br />Ravindra Jadeja, Player of the Match:</strong> I would say this is my lucky ground, whenever I come here I get positive vibes. I was looking to build a partnership with Rishabh, give him the strike and enjoy his batting from the other end. To be honest I don't know about any stat. Feeling very good, happy to score runs and pick wickets for the team. Obviously, as a player, you boost your confidence with such a performance. I have not done anything differently, just played to my strengths. I haven't played with the SG pink ball, so it is going to be different and I will practice for a couple of days, hopefully it comes good.</p>",

A brilliant half-century from Shreyas Iyer helped India post a fighting total on board, after which Bumrah took the limelight, picking up his first 5-fer in home conditions to restrict Sri Lanka to 109. Fifties from Shreyas Iyer and Rishabh Pant in the third innings helped India set a mammoth target of 447.

We have a good team, the batting didn't capitalize on these conditions, the bowling was good, but we kept bowling loose deliveries every now and then, that's what we need to work on going further. There have been several youngsters coming up and this was an experience for them.

Shreyas just carried on from the T20s, he didn't get out there a single time and he's carried it into the Tests. Pant seems to get better in every Test, especially in these conditions. The England series at home was challenging but looks like the confidence is back, with his catches and stumpings. Ashwin does something for the team whenever he's given the ball, gives a match-winning performance every time he's given the ball, so I think he's a legend of the game. The crowd coming back and celebrating with us has been so pleasing.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Shreyas Iyer is the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Shreyas Iyer</strong> - \"That wasn't my normal approach, but I saw the batters struggling, so I knew I had to be attacking and put the pressure back on the bowlers. I have always dreamt about playing Test cricket for India, good feeling to come and contribute, want to keep this going.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Rishabh Pant is the Player of the Series.</strong></p><p><strong>Rishabh Pant</strong> - \"I think you need to keep evolving with both batting and keeping, I've made mistakes in the past and want to keep improving. It's not in my mindset, the wicket was difficult to play, so I thought I will look for quick runs. With regards to keeping I think it's more about confidence, previously, I used to think too much, now I'm only focusing on every ball.\"</p>",

The ICC top-ranked team - India is set to host South Africa for five T20I matches and it would be an exciting contest. Rishabh Pant will lead India for the first time in the absence of injured KL Rahul who was announced initially as the captain. If India wins this match, it will be a world record to win 13 T20I games on a trot. Will India win and register their record or will South Africa start well in this series?&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>When the last time South Africa faced India for the T20I series was in 2019. The three-match T20I series ended in a tie with both the teams winning one game.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>The average first innings score at this venue is 195 in IPL 2021. This venue has favoured the teams batting second as the teams have won three out of the four matches in 2021's IPL. Will we see another high-scoring thriller tonight?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Deep Dasgupta: \"The last international game played here was way back in 2019. The dimensions are small here, only 61 meters on the western side and 63 on the eastern, straight down is 74. It looks like it has a bit of grass which is dry. It is a little patchy but the surface itself is quite firm. You can see the cracks here which might help the spinners but still seems a high scoring match. Dew is not a factor.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>South Africa have won the toss and they elect to bowl first!</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Temba Bavuma, South Africa Captain:</strong> \"We are going to have a bowl first.It was a bit slow and stoppy at the beginning, hopefully we can exploit that and restrict them to a decent score and chase it down. Aiden was not available for selection as he tested positive for Covid, Stubbs comes and it is a debut for him. We have two all-rounders, Dwaine and Parnell. It is an important series as we haven't been together as a group since the World Cup, it is a preparation for the World Cup coming up in Australia.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Rishabh Pant, India Captain:</strong> \"I think it's a good surface and I don't mind batting first. Had I won the toss, I would have bowled. Captaining India is one of the proudest moments in my career. Thank you for the opportunity. We're trying to give roles to different players.&nbsp;We know our XI but at the same time we are giving different roles to players and see how they cope with that going forward. Ishan and Ruturaj will open. DK is back.\"</p>",

After being put to bat first, the IND batters started off well with 51 runs in the powerplay. Ishan Kishan constructed 76 runs and the other middle-order batters took up on the spinners and scored 70 runs from the five overs of which the spinners bowled. R Pant (29 off 16) and H Pandya (31* off 12) played explosively and guided the team to a total of 211 which was the highest against SA. With a huge target to chase, D Pretorius bravely took on the bowlers and played an aggressive brand of cricket but the team lost two wickets within the powerplay. R Van Der Dussen (75* off 46) and D Miller (64* off 31) then partnered for 131* runs and chased the targets with still 7 wickets and five balls to spare!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, India captain:</strong></span> \"We had enough runs on the board, but I think we were a little off with the execution.

We were very happy with the total but next time we are in a similar situation we will do better.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Temba Bavuma, South Africa Captain:</strong></span> \"We expected the wicket to get better as the night went on. Fortunately the batting came through. Bit tricky to assess the bowling. It was fair considering how good that wicket was. They put us under pressure when our spinners were bowling. Proper batting display. David carried his form and well supported by Rassie.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>David Miller is the Player of the match</strong></p><p>David Miller: \"Obviously a lot of hard work has gone in over the last few years understanding my game a lot better. You need two players playing a part while chasing. Rassie played phenomenally well at the back end with some big overs. Chuffed with the result. Just try and hang in there was the chat. Just about limiting dot balls and waiting for that loose ball. Understanding winning more games and more consistency gives you more belief. I am pretty open to bat anywhere. Just want to make a difference.\"</p>",

Fair amount of cracks as well but doesn't seem to grip too much as well. It is going to skid through and not much for the spinners.

We don't know how the wicket will play. It was easier to bat second in the last game. You can chase anything with smaller boundaries, You need to stay in the fight as bowlers. We have got two forced changes: Quinton and Stubbs miss out. Quinton has a hand injury. So, Reeza Hendricks comes in and will open the batting with me. Klassen will come in and keep wickets.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, India Captain:</strong></span> \"We were also looking to bowl first on this surface.

Ishan Kishan (34 off 21) and Shreyas Iyer (40 off 35) partnered for 45 runs and then the South African bowlers restricted the partnerships to grow. Dinesh Karthik's 30* off 21 steered the team to a total of 148. In the chase, Indian bowlers gained initial momentum by picking three wickets within the powerplay and restricting the team to a total of 29.

While, it hasnt been the same for India as South Africa comfortably won both of the matches. This is a do or die match for India in order to stay alive in the series.

The spinners have got a lot of purchase before it looks a much better pitch tonight to bat on. It sounds firm, looks like it has been rolled in really well. I don't think this will be a low-scorer. 170-180 could be a par total. I don't expect the spinners to get great assistance.

We were 15 runs short, but we weren't thinking about that. Bowlers did a fantastic job for us. There is pressure on the spinners to perform well, when they come off nicely matches like this happen. When you get a good start, it's difficult for a new batter to come in and go big straight away. We lost too many wickets. We'll look to improve in the next match.

Today, I changed my seam position. Spinning and getting the ball to dip are my strengths. Today I tried to get it to turn and bowl slower. Now I have a second plan and set fields accordingly. I didn't bowl well in the previous game, the coach asked me to back my strengths.\"</p>",

This match is to be held at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Rajkot. The series started with South Africa claiming victories in the first two matches after which in the third T20I, India defended and registered their first victory against South Africa this year. India need to win this match in order to equal the series and hence they can face the decider on Sunday. Will India win tonight and tie the series or will South africa claim the trophy with a win?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>A total of 12 International and IPL matches have been played here and the teams chasing have won the target seven times. The average first innings score is 170/6.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>In India, South Africa has won five matches and India has won two!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Deep Dasgupta: \"This is a big ground. Tonight when you look at the pitch there is a lot of grass and this grass has a thick root structure which indicates there might be spongy bounce tonight. Also, there are quite a few cracks running along the pitch and around those cracks the grass is more prominent. I have a feeling it might help the seamers with the new ball. Even though there is this layer of grass I think it will be a high-scoring game again. There isn't much dew and this has generally been a chasing venue.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>South Africa have won the toss and will bowl first!</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Temba Bavuma, South African Captain:</span> </strong>\"We are going to have a bowl.

They bowled brilliantly upfront and made it tough for us. It was a tough pitch to bat on. It was hard to hit boundaries. Our openers have usually been kind enough to get us off to good starts. When I went in Hardik told me to take my time. It was important that players who have been around for long need to stand up on such pitches.

The series so far has been exciting and the competition is now neck to neck with the first two being won by South Africa and the next two by India. The final match today will decide the better of the two teams and the series would not have a better end! Will India beat South Africa and win the series against the opponents for the first time (In India) after 2011 or will South Africa change the record of India's unbeaten bilateral series home record since 2019?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>In 2019, 7 IPL and 2 International matches have been played at the venue. Considering the stated matches in 2019, the average first innings total remains at 163 and the teams batting second have won five matches.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Deep Dasgupta: \"This venue has been a nightmare for bowlers but we have seen a lot of fireworks from the batters. 67m side boundaries, the straight boundary is 77m. The pitch today is nice and firm, something the batters enjoy. There are some decent number of cracks where the spinners would land the ball and they are wide. The smaller pieces are wobbly too. So this might help spinners and the pitch seems abrasive to the touch. It's been overcast for the last 4-5 days, so haven't seen much of dew. Having said that the chasing side has benefited a lot in general here. The toss might be important for this decider.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>South Africa have won the toss and they elect to bowl first!</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Keshav Maharaj, South African Skipper:</strong>&nbsp;</span>\"Looks a good wicket and we have decided to bowl first. <strong>Stubbs, Reeza Hendricks and KG Rabada are back, they replace Temba Bavuma, Marco Jansen and Shamsi.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We have gone for the extra batter, four-seamers, and one spinner. We will look to chase it down in the back end. We have to focus on our process. When we are bowling we have to bowl good line and lengths and in batting we have to apply ourselves.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, Indian Skipper:&nbsp;</strong></span>\"Looks like a good wicket, we would like to get anything around 180-190. We just need to focus on the process and put in our 100% into the game. <strong>We are playing the same team.</strong>\"</p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>The decider and the final T20I of the South Africa tour of India which took place at M.Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru was abandoned due to rain. South Africa won the toss and they decided to bowl first. The match started at 7:50 after the delay from rain and the openers partnered for 20 runs after which L Ngidi dismissed both of them. With Shreyas Iyer and Rishabh Pant in the crease with 3.3 overs bowled, it started to shower again and the match was interrupted. There were no signs of weather improvements and in the end, the match was abandoned with the match and the series ending with No Result.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the Player of the Series</strong></p><p><strong>Bhuvneshwar Kumar:</strong>&nbsp;\"Really proud. Winning the Man Of the Series is always special. Feels good, don't want to talk much about it. I am more focussed on playing well and keeping my fitness in shape. I am playing for years now. My role is always the same. Bowl two in the powerplay and then bow two in the back end. Being a senior, I always think about helping out the young guys.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Keshav Maharaj, South African Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Very disappointed we didn't get a full game for the end of an exciting tour. I am sure the future series against India will be interesting like this one. We carried our confidence from past tours at the same time we didn't want to take anything for granted.&nbsp;Really exciting, I wish the game would have gone on and South Africa won that. I think we are bit disappointed with the last two matches. We pushed our chests a bit. That's a solid Indian unit and we couldn't quite take them lightly.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant, Indian skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"It might be a little frustrating but at the same time there are lot of positives. The whole team came back really well so a lot of positives rather than being frustrated. We are finding different ways to win matches. As long as we keep improving from our mistakes, we will be fine. The only thing is only giving 100 percent. We will want to win that one Test in England and contribute more with the bat.\"</p>",

After the continuous showers at the venue, the match was reduced to a 12-over game. With India winning the toss and deciding to bowl first, the bowlers took the wickets of the top three batters of Ireland within the powerplay and cooked up the pressure straight away. After which, the classy innings from Harry Tector (64* off 33) put the team in a better position with the score of 108 runs! With 109 to chase in 12 overs, the Indian openers Ishan Kishan (26 off 11) and Deepak Hooda (47* off 29) provided a fiery start. Craig young picked two wickets back to back but Hardik Pandya who came later smashed 24 off 12 and the team chased the target with still 16 balls remaining!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Andrew Balbirnie, Ireland Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Never easy when you come to the ground, do your full warmup and it's delayed. Credit to the groundsman. It was high-class bowlers bowling with assisting conditions in the first innings. We weren't as good early on. Tector batted outstandingly well to get up to the total. We were good and we were bad. Against a team like India, you have to be good.\"</p><div>\u00a0</div><div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Great to start the series with a win, fortunate we got a game. Important for our team to start with a win. Umran was kept back after I had a chat with him, he's more comfortable with the older ball and they batted fantastically. So hope he gets an opportunity.

Coming down the memory lane, India toured England in 2021 for a five-match test series. With the first match ending in a draw, the second test at Lord's cricket ground was won by India. Then in the third Test, it was England who won the match by an innings and 76 runs. India made a huge comeback in the fourth test and sealed the match after which, with India leading the series 2-1, the final match at Manchester was cancelled due to the covid-19 pandemic. Here, we resume from where we left behind and if India claims victory or draws this match, India will lift the trophy! If England wins this match, the series would end with both teams winning 2 games and it would be a draw. Both the teams are set to enter with new skippers from the previous encounter and it would be nothing short of entertainment and a true cricketing fan's experience.

With England winning the toss, they forced India to bat first. After losing early wickets, R Pant and R Jadeja partnered for 222 runs and both scored brilliant centuries and guided the team to a total of 416 runs. J Anderson was the highest wicket-taker in the first innings as he added a fifer to his name. With the ball, the Indian bowlers bowled explicitly well and kept on taking wickets in regular intervals except for J Bairstow who was dismissed only after his reviving century. The England team was all out for 284 runs. In the third innings, the Indian opener C Pujara scored 66 runs after which R Pant continued his form and made 57 runs. The team was then all-out for 245 runs! With a target of 378 to chase, the English batters started off brilliantly and the rest was carried over by J Root and J Bairstow who put up centuries and the team chased down the target with still 7 wickets remaining!

The last month has been fantastic for the lads and the smiles on their faces when everyone does well is a massive part of it. I am stripping it back to the basics. The last few years have been tough on me but the last few months have been fantastic. The chase was all under control. They have some world-class bowlers and you just have to soak the pressure. There was a period when it started reversing as well. And today morning was a different morning. Special to play with Root.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Joe Root is England's Player of the Series:</strong></span></p><p>Joe Root: \"Love playing. It's as simple as that. The environment has been great and the guys are having fun in the last four weeks. There is absolute clarity that we were chasing it down and there was total belief. There are a bunch of lovely lads and Stokes has the backing of everyone. Our responsibility is to keep everyone entertained and keep it fun. Still watching Jonny bat is great, I just wanted to give him strike. We have been riding a brilliant wave of confidence after brilliant performances against NZ. The start the two openers got us off to was superb and they put the pressure back on. It made it a lot more easier for us and those scores were a lot more than what was seen on the scoresheet.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jasprit Bumrah, India's Player of the Series: </strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jasprit Bumrah, Indian Captain:</strong></span> \"That's the beauty of Test cricket, even if you have three good days. We fell short with the bat yesterday and that is where we let the opposition in to let the match slip away from us. Ifs and buts can always be there. If you go back, if there was no rain in the first match, we could have won the series. But England played really well. We have drawn the series and both teams played very good cricket and it was a fair result. We were ahead in the game. Dravid is always there to guide us and back us. We could have been a little straighter in our bowling lines and use the variable bounce. The captaincy is not what I decide. I like the responsibilty. It was a good challenge, a new challenge. It was an honour to lead the team and a great experience.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Ben Stokes, England Captain:</strong></span> \"When the lads play like this, it makes my job easier. When you have clarity like we have in the dressing room, it makes chasing totals like this easier. 378 would have been scary five weeks ago, but now it's all good. Jonny and Root will get all the credit, but the precedent was set up by the way the openers played against Bumrah and Shami with the new ball. It is all about taking wickets and taking ten wickets. There are no complaints. We are trying to rewrite how Test cricket is played in England. We know that we want to give some new life to Test cricket. The support we received has been fantastic in the short time that we've been around. Inspiring the next generation is what we want to do. We want to bring in new fans and want to leave a mark on Test cricket.\"</p>",

India has played four T20s in the last 10 days including the practice games, has won 13 of the 15 T20Is since the World Cup, and will look to build on this good form heading into the T20 World Cup later this year.<br /><br /><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two sides have played 19 T20I's so far with India edging the head to head with 10 victories.

Looks like a good pitch, the sun is out and better to bat first. Recovered pretty well, had a couple of hits before getting into this game, looking forward to the game as well. Exciting times, these guys have been here for a while playing in Ireland and played a couple of games here as well. <strong>We are making Arshdeep play.</strong> He has done well in the IPL and looks an exciting prospect.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Skipper:</strong></span> \"Very proud day, great honour to get to captain your country and looking forward to the challenges ahead. <strong>Gleeson, Willey, and Salt miss out.</strong> We have got a couple of all-rounders in Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone, they give us a lot of options with both ball and bat.\"</p>",

After skipper Rohit Sharma won the toss and chose to bat, India got off to a flyer in the Powerplay scoring 66 runs courtesy of quickfire innings from Rohit Sharma, Deepak Hooda and Suryakumar Yadav, after which Hardik Pandya continued with the run flow and registered his maiden T20I half-century to guide India to 198 on board at the end of 20 overs. In the chase, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Arshdeep Singh used the new ball to great effect and Hardik picked up two crucial wickets in an over to restrict England to 32/3 inside the Powerplay. Moeen Ali and Harry Brook put on a 50-run stand in the middle but India continued to pick up wickets in regular intervals and bowled out England for 148.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Skipper:</strong></span> \"They bowled well with the new ball and put us under pressure, we couldn't get away from that point.

We know the boys have the talent and we want to see them on the big stage.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</strong></span> \"Great performance from ball one, all our batters showed intent. Although the pitch was good, we played good shots and never got ahead of the game. You got to make use of those six overs in the powerplay and there is a certain approach we want to take in the powerplay. You got to back yourself in this game as sometimes it comes off, sometimes it doesn't. The whole batting unit needs to understand the direction the team is taking and the guys were spot on today. We were sloppy on the field, those catches should have been taken. Pretty sure we will field pretty well in the coming games.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Hardik Pandya is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya:</strong></span> \"The last time I played a T20 in England, I think I took 4 wickets and scored some 30, so I kind of knew I was the first Indian to score fifty and take 4 wickets. I am enjoying my cricket right now. For me, a lot of time goes into preparation and getting my body ready. It is about giving your 100% and when you don't do that, there is no point playing, so I needed that break and now I am happy to be in this place right now.\"</p>",

We wanted someone to bat through and get us a score, Jadeja had scored a hundred here and he carried on from there, he was calm and finished it well towards the end. We understand the importance of the powerplay, be it scoring runs or taking wickets. We look forward to another game tomorrow. We need to keep ticking the boxes and move forward.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Bhuvneshwar Kumar:</strong></span> \"When the ball swings you enjoy bowling.

After clinching the T20I series, India would look forward to claiming the ODI series too, whereas the opponents England won the last T20I match and would want to continue their momentum in the extended version of the format. Who will start the ODI series on a high?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Since 2019, 7 matches have been played here of which five have been won by the teams batting first and two by the team bowling first. 78.85% of wickets are taken by the seam bowlers and the average first innings total remains at 273/7.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>India and England at this stadium, have played eight ODI's in which England have won 5 and India have won two.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: </strong></span>\"We are going to bowl first. There is some grass cover and it's overcast as well. We want to have a score in front of us. It's important to take wickets up front and put brakes on the scoring. We understand the importance of playing overseas, we want to do well outside India. Today is no different. We have five batters, two all-rounders, and four bowlers. <strong>Kohli is not playing this game, Shreyas will bat at 3.</strong>\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We would have done the same thing, we would have bowled first. Looking forward to the ODI series, it has been a great learning experience. It's great to welcome those guys back. Root, Bairstow, Stokes are a few of the best players in the world. There are a lot of selfless guys in the team, that will be exactly the same today.\"</p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1-10 Overs) :-</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">England- 30/5 (3.0 rpo, 4x4, 0x6) </span>|| <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India- 56/0 (5.6 rpo, 7x4, 2x6)</span></strong></p><p><strong>Middle Overs (11-40 Overs) :-&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>England- 93/5 (6.1 rpo, 12x4, 1x6)) </strong></span><strong>||</strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong> India- 58/0 (6.7 rpo, 4x4, 3x6)</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The Indian team displayed a dominating performance and beat England by 10 wickets for the first time in history! After winning the toss and electing to bowl first, the Indian bowlers Jasprit Bumrah (6/19) and Mohammed Shami (3/31) dismissed four key batters of the English side for a duck. Apart from the innings of Jos Buttler (30 off 32), the other batters couldn't settle much and the team was all out for a total of 110 in 25.2 overs. With an easy target to chase, the Indian openers Shikhar Dhawan (31* off 54) and Rohit Sharma (76* off 58) paired up for their 18th 100-run partnership and took the team to victory by 10 wickets! Bumrah was deservingly awarded the player of the match for his career-best figure of 6/18. With this win, India lead the series!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Skipper: </strong></span>\"Very tough day to take, but we've got to dust ourselves down quickly. Little surprised by the movement, bit muggy. India exposed the conditions superbly. They have bowled really well in the powerplay. It is something we need to discuss and work out. Jasprit is a great bowler to come up against. He has bowled well today and deserves these figures. It is never easy when you are forced to try and wickets. Isn't nice when your bowlers have to take as may risks and when you ask so much out of them.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper:</strong></span> \"Looking at the overhead conditions and the pitch, the toss was a right call to make. We used the conditions upfront really well. We never worry about the conditions because we have got the guys who can just come out and use those conditions. There was some swing and seam up front and we exploited them well. When you play in such conditions, you have to understand the assistance and have field placements accordingly. The hook is a high-risk shot, I understand that, but as long as it comes out right, I am happy.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Jasprit Bumrah is the Player of the match</strong></p><div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jasprit Bumrah:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"When there's swing and seam movement, it is very exciting in white-ball cricket to get that opportunity because you have to be defensive with the kind of pitches we usually get. When I bowled the first ball, I found some swing and we tried to exploit that. When it doesn't swing, I have to pull my lengths back. When the ball is doing something you don't have to try a lot. As soon as Shami bowled the first over, we had a conversation to go fuller. Very happy for him, he gets a lot of wickets. When the ball is moving around, the keeper and the cordon is very active. Very happy that Rishabh has been working hard on his keeping as well as his batting.\"</div></div>",

Less grass for sure but looks like there is some moisture in the pitch. Looking at the size of the ground, we thought it's better to have a score on the board. <strong>Virat Kohli comes back in for Shreyas Iyer.</strong> He's (Bumrah) a proper bowler, no matter which the format is. GIves us a different dimension and can bowl in any phases of the game. Always nice to have a bowler like him in the squad. Pant did take some really good catches. They were very important for us.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Skipper:</strong>&nbsp;</span>\"We would have bowled first as well. A 50-50 decision to be honest. Seems like a bit of moisture and might be tricky early on, if we can survive that, we should be fine. <strong>We're going with the same team.</strong> I think we've got to move on and just think it as one of those off-days.

After winning the toss and forcing England to bat first, the English openers Roy and Bairstow started to settle, after which the Indian bowlers came into the play and dismissed the batters in regular successions. The 62-run partnership between M Ali (47 off 64) and D Willey (41 off 49) put the team in a better position and the score, in the end, was 246. Y Chahal picked four wickets for just 47 runs in ten overs. In the chase, the English bowlers cooked up pressure on the Indian batters straight away by restricting runs and taking crucial wickets. There were a few partnerships between S Yadav-Hardik and R Jadeja-Shami but did not last long and the team was all out for 146 runs in the 39th over.

They had a partnership in the middle with Moeen and Willey. By no means that target wasn't chaseable but we didn't bat well. Have to take catches, something we've been talking a lot. All in all, we bowled pretty well. Thought the pitch will get better and better. Playing against a team like that, you need to get your five best bowlers and allrounder. Leaves a long tail. So have to ensure as a top-order, one of the guys bats long. Going to be an exciting one at Manchester.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Delighted with the response from the guys. Didn't bat our best, but got a challenging score. And the way the guys bowled was fantastic. Traditionally has been a bat-first wicket here. Willey and Ali put on a great partnership.

It looks like a good track and won't change for the course of 100 overs. It is the series decider and we have played some good cricket on the tour, we took the learnings from the last game. We bowled well in the limited overs , hopefully, we can restrict them today to a reasonable target. <strong>Bumrah has a niggle, so Siraj comes in</strong>.\"</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><div><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We would have looked to bat. It is a little muggy and there might be some swing early on, but will get better for batting as the game progresses. It is great for the series as it is 1-1 coming into this game.

India once again won the toss and elected to bowl first. M Siraj took back-to-back wickets in the second over and imposed pressure straight away on the English team. The partnership between J Buttler (60 off 80) and M Ali (34 off 44) was worth 75 runs and the team put up a total of 259 runs. H Pandya was impressive with the ball as he took a four-wicket haul! In the chase, the English bowler R Topley dismissed the top three batters of India within the powerplay. R Pant (125* off 113) and H Pandya (71 off 55) paired up for 133 runs and steered the team to one of the memorable victories in the history!</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant is the Player of the match</strong></span></div></div></div><div>\u00a0</div><div><div><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rishabh Pant:</span> </strong>Hopefully I remember this knock for the rest of my life. I was focusing on one ball at a time when I was batting. When your team is under pressure and you bat like that, something I aspire to do. I always enjoy playing in England, at the same time enjoy the atmosphere and the situation. The more you play the more experience you gain. It was a good wicket to bat on and the bowlers did a commendable job to restrict them, they were brilliant not only today but for the entire series.\"</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya is the Player of the series</strong></span></div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"White ball is something close to me. We all know such a good team England is. For us, as a team, it was important for us to come here, set out the plans what we'll bowl. Important for me to stop the runs, bowl as many dot balls. They were cruising at one point. I love short balls. Don't fancy people taking me on. Gets me into the game. Don't mind getting hit for six sixes also if I can get a wicket. The partnership changed the game for us. The way he finished the game was also special.\"</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I thought we were short. Needed a good start which we got actually. Throughout the whole summer so far we haven't batted our best. Topley has&nbsp;been brilliant. Delighted to see him doing so well. It's been a tough schedule. Half-chance with Pandya as well, along with the stumping. If we took our chances, with India's tail, could've got hold of the game. I've found it absolutely fine to be honest. Missed a chance but don't think it's got anything to do with captaincy.\"</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper:</strong></span> \"Very pleased. Wanted to achieve something as a group in white ball. We were here last time and were beaten, I remember that. Not an easy place to come and win games. It was a good pitch, but we do understand it's not going to be easy if we lose wickets upfront. Positive side of it, these guys haven't batted much in the middle overs. Today we got to see that with Hardik and Rishabh. At no point we felt they were panicking. They backed themselves and played cricketing shots. To be honest, the wicket didn't have much. We played some not so good shots. Still back those guys to come out good. One of those series where top order hasn't come to the party. Have got nothing more to say because I know the quality they bring to the team.\"</div></div></div></div></div>",

The Indian team successfully completed its white-ball mission on a high in England, whereas the opponents recently played against Bangladesh and the team got whitewashed. Who will turn victorious today and start the series with a positive momentum?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>In the previous 4 years, the two teams have played 15 ODIs against each other and India has dominated the West Indies on 11 games and the opposition has managed to win only two.

I'm a very cool captain and like to guide the team, I will love to take the right decision but importantly make sure the process is right, we are focussing on the process and make sure we get the right result.

Then, S Iyer at number three carried the momentum forward by scoring 54 runs. In the end, the Indian team posted a total of 308 runs. In reply, K Mayers (75 off 68) paired up with S Brooks (46 off 61) for 117 runs and provided a solid start. B King's 54 runs were crucial in the middle after which the quick cameo from R Shepherd (39* off 25) almost took the team over the line but the Indian bowlers held their nerves and Siraj (2/57) defended 15 runs on the final over and the team has begun their tour with a victory!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nicholas Pooran, West Indies Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Feels like a win for us.

With a target of 311, S Gill (43 off 49) started steadily and Shreyas at number three scored consecutive half-centuries and built the score along with S Samson who got his maiden fifty today.

        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>The third and the final ODI of the India tour of West Indies comes to an end as India clean sweeps West Indies. After winning the toss and electing to bat first, the openers S Dhawan (58 off 74) and S Gill (98* off 98) provided a solid start! S Iyer who came at number three made 44 runs off 34 balls. The play was interrupted twice due to rain and the overs were reduced. S Gill missed his maiden century by just two runs. In the end, the Indian team had a score of 225/3 in 36 overs. The target was revised due to rain and West Indies were to chase 257 in 35 overs by DLS calculation. In the chase, M Siraj plunked pressure on WI batters straight away by taking two wickets in the second over of the innings for no runs on the board. B King (42 off 37) and N Pooran (42 off 32) tried to revive the innings but were dismissed at the right time. Then the Indian bowlers took over the game and dismissed all the batters of WI for 137 runs and won the match by 119 runs (DLS method). Y Chahal accounted for 4 wickets for just 17 runs and S Gill was rightly awarded the Player of the match for his innings with the bat.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nicholas Pooran, West Indies Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"It was a tough one for us. We did a lot of right things in the first two games. I think we tried up our best, the boys performed well. As a batting group, it was going to be a challenge with DLS coming into play. We did get some partnerships, but not as many as we wanted, that cost us the game. There are a few inexperienced players, still figuring out how to play ODI cricket. The bowlers bowled well in the powerplay, they didn't get wickets, but that's fine. The guys are getting more confident with every game. Very excited with our T20 team, looking forward to the game on Friday.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Shubman Gill is the Player of the Match and Series</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Was hoping to get a hundred, but that was not under my control. Was very disappointed with how I got out in the first two ODIs. I tried to play according to the ball and let my instincts take over. I wanted only one more over, was hoping for that. The wicket played fantastically in all three games. The ball was gripping a bit after 30 overs. Happy with my performance.\"</p><div>\u00a0</div><div><div><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, Indian Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I feel the boys are young, but they played maturely. The way they handled themselves on the field, really proud of them. Very good signs for us. I am quite pleased with my form, I have been playing this format since a long time. I was happy with the way I played that knock, in the first ODI. The way all the boys responded, it was pretty amazing. We feel lucky to come here, we are thankful to the crowd. I am proud of our bowling unit, they gave their hundred percent. The way Siraj took those two wickets, and the way Shardul and others bowled.\"</div></div>",

It was a great effort from the boys and a great finish. We want to try certain things and all in all I thought it was a great effort. Certain pitches will not allow you to do that and we need to assess how we go about it. It is all about backing your skills and strengths. I love playing here in West Indies.

After winning the toss and forcing India to bat first, the WI bowlers took three wickets within the powerplay. The quickfire innings from R Pant (24 off 12) and the anchoring partnership between H Pandya (31 off 31) and R Jadeja (27 off 30) guided the team to a total of 138. In the chase, B King (68 off 52) - the opener steered the team from the front and D Thomas towards the end played a quick cameo of 31* from 19 balls and took the team across the line with still 5 wickets and four balls remaining. O McCoy was awarded the man of the match for his wonderful six-wicket haul (6/17).&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper:</strong></span> \"Firstly, there weren't enough runs on the board. We didn't bat well. The pitch was playing nicely but we didn't apply ourselves. But this can happen. When you are doing something as a batting group, you might not always succeed. But we will learn from this. It is all about giving opportunities to these guys. Unless you give chances to guys like Avesh and Arshdeep you'll never know. But it is just one game. They have the skills and the talent and it is all about backing them. I am really proud of the bowlers and the team. I thought the guys executed the plans and really happy with the way the guys bowled. We have to look at some things in our batting.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nicholas Pooran, West Indies Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I can finally breathe now. It has been a tough summer for us. We lost a few close games and nearly made a mess of this as well. Obed was fantastic and all the guys just used the pitch and the conditions well. A win is a win. I believe in T20, better batsmen have to bat long. King should have won the game for us with the way he was batting. But hopefully he will learn from this. Thomas returned back for us after injury and came out trumps on his home ground. Obed is a bit of a freak and today he was just fantastic.

After the Indian team was put to bat first by WI, the openers Rohit and S Yadav played explosively and recorded 65 runs in the powerplay. R Pant who carried forward the innings in his style scored 44 runs off 31 balls! Samson (30* off 23) and Axar (20* off 8) provided runs swiftly in the death and the team reached a good score of 191 runs. In the chase, Avesh Khan picked up early wickets in the powerplay and imposed pressure. With a high score to chase, the WI batters tried to play explosively and lost wickets at regular intervals. Arshdeep Singh accounted for three wickets and the team was all out for 132 runs in the first ball of the last over!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nicholas Pooran, West Indies Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We know they got off to a flying start, but I was happy with the way our guys came back. Unfortunately, we didn't get a partnership, it was a par score. Not ideal to get run out, it changed the game. Akeal was brilliant with the ball. The others too need to find their rhythm and find the game. But having said that, congratulations to India. As a unit, we want to win games and tomorrow is an opportunity to take it. It is all about building up to that World Cup and finding that balance.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I think it was pleasing how we played the game. The conditions were not easy but we got a good score. A lot of thought went into how we batted and it was pleasing to see. The pitch was quite slow which our bowlers used to their advantage. I thought 190 was a good score, but with the kind of batting that WI have, no score is good. We played good cricket to get the win today. The batters were really smart and the bowlers bowled in pairs to get wickets. It put the brakes on their scoring. I would also like to thank all the people who came in.\"</p><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Avesh Khan is the Player of the Match</strong></span></div><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Avesh Khan</strong>:</span>&nbsp;\"I feel really good because I didn't do well in the last two games. I just focussed on my strengths today, bowling the hard lengths. My coaches and my captain told me that they were backing me.I am focussing on the next match that is left now. The ball was stopping a bit on the wicket and so I was just mixing my slower deliveries with the hard lengths, which gave me the results. Happy that the crowd came to see us.\"</p>",

India has been impressive so far and has managed to wrap up the series in the fourth game itself. A collective effort has been the reason for Team India's success down in the Caribbean. Rohit Sharma has been spot on in using his resources and has tried to give an opportunity to almost everyone in the squad. The positive approach has translated into the team's performance as every player has been up to the task whenever offered with a chance to express. West Indies will play for pride whereas the Indian team would like to end things on a positive note. It will be interesting to see what the side looks like and which youngster gets a chance to play the game.

All eyes will be on KL Rahul who returns to the side and will also lead alongside Shikhar Dhawan as his deputy. The two teams have encountered 63 times in ODIs, out of which 51 have gone Team India's way and 10 have gone in favour of Zimbabwe. Team India is traveling to Zimbabwe after six years and will definitely get some valuable game time ahead of the important Asia Cup and tournaments to follow.It will be interesting to see the playing combination as Deepak Chahar returns after recovering from an injury and also whether Rahul Tripathi makes his debut. India appears as the clear favorite and will look to keep the good record in Zimbabwe intact.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>TOSS:-</p><p><strong>India has won the toss and elected to field.</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Team India Captain, KL Rahul</strong></span> - \"We will field first. Looks like a good wicket, it's an early start, so could have a bit of moisture that can be exploited. Good opportunity to bowl first and take advantage of the first hour. A lot of guys have got opportunities, good chance to challenge themselves and their skills. Looking forward to a good show\".&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>Team Zimbabwe Captain, Regis Chakabva </strong></span>- \"We would have bowled first as well, but this looks like a good wicket and will stay the same for the rest of the day.

Thereafter, It was the Indian openers who took care of the rest. The duo managed to chase down the total in just over 30 overs with Gill and Dhawan getting 82* and 81* respectively. Another dominating win for Team India which also happens to be the 13th consecutive win against Zimbabwe!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepak Chahar is the player of the match!</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepak Chahar:</strong></span><strong> </strong>\"The landing was a little hard and when you play a international game after six and half months, obviously you will be a little nervous.

I'm fine and the body is fine as well\".</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">Regis Chakabva, Zimbabwean skipper:</span></strong>&nbsp;\"The Indian bowlers bowled really well, put the pressure on us and we lost our way after the first 4-5 overs. It was good to see Richi (Ngarava) and Brad give us that partnership at the end. We needed to have one or two big partnerships, but it didn't happen today. Our bowlers tried to come hard at them, but obviously they batted really well and took the game away from us\".</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, Indian skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp; \"There was a bit of swing and seam movement, but it was good to see the bowlers stay disciplined and pick up those wickets. For a few of us, it is great to be back in the Indian dressing room. As a team, we have been in good form, good to see that all of us are getting enough game time. Feels good to be out there\".</p>",

The openers started cautiously and thereafter it was the 'Shubman Gill show' that helped India get to a total of 289. Gill scored 130 of just 97 balls and was also involved in a 140 run match winning partnership along with Ishan Kishan who scored a well-composed fifty. The Zimbabwean middle order kept the match alive courtesy of some fine hitting from Sikandar Raza who made 115 of 95 balls but eventually succumbed to the pressure. Avesh Khan was the pick of the bowlers scalping three while the spinners Kuldeep and Axar contained the opposition picking 2 wickets each. Zimbabwe fell short by just 13 runs in the end.

The bat was pretty good. That's why I changed it after my 50, I wanted to save it. Definitely special on hitting his maiden international ton.

We know this is a high-scoring ground. You can't relax even if you get 200. We took wickets to an extent, but they played really well.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Aaron Finch, Australian Captain:</span></strong> \"It was a good contest, wasn't it? We had some really good partnerships, there were some good contests between the bat and ball. They came hard at us. You expect the run rate to slow down if you lose wickets. The batters tried to change the momentum of the game. That's what we play for, we still try to instill all the processes leading into the World Cup\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Cameron Green is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p>\"It was a good experience opening the innings alongside Finch. I enjoyed Hardik Pandya's batting too. Loved the way he connects the ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was kind of good to watch them bat, and that gave us an idea about how to go about while chasing\"</p><div>\u00a0</div>",

The first match was a high-scoring thriller where Hardik Pandya for India and Cameron Green for Australia shined with the bat and the match ended in the favour of the visitors where they chased down the target in the last over. The Indian team would be all set to reply back with a win tonight and to null the series to take the decider to the final one on Sunday.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT</strong></p><p><strong>Ravi Shastri:</strong> \"Pretty overcast and it is very humid. This pitch looks tacky. Normally teams winning the toss bat first. With the rain around, teams might want to do otherwise. There is a darkish look to the pitch which suggests that the covers have been on. It is dry as well. It looks two-paced as well. The ball will hold up and turn. The par score is 150, and it shouldn't change much.\"</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain</strong>:</span><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;\"We're going to field first. It is nice to get a game. These games are challenging because you don't know what to do. You just have to go out and express yourself. Hopefully, we can put up a good show. Since it is an eight-over game, we had to make two changes:<strong> Bumrah comes in for Umesh Yadav.</strong>\"</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Aaron Finch, Australian Captain:</span>&nbsp;\"</strong><span style=\"color:#222222\">We would have bowled first as well.

We're happy with the way we played and the execution. <strong>Two Changes&nbsp;Ellis is injured and Sams comes in.</strong> <strong>Sean Abbott comes in for Inglis.</strong>\"</span></p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>India showcased fireworks in the eight-over thriller by chasing down the target of 91 and taking the team home! The match was delayed and reduced to eight overs due to the wet outfield. After winning the toss, India put Australia to bat first. A Finch (31* off 15) provided a good start early on and M Wade finished the match well with 43* off 20. In the second innings, the skipper Rohit Sharma led the team from the front by hitting 46* runs. The team in the end chased the target and equaled the series. The final match on Sunday will be the decider!&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Aaron Finch, Australian Captain:</strong></span> \"Rohit played brilliantly and two overs of Axar made the difference. Wade is a calm customer at the back end and he has grown into that finisher's role. Zampa was good too.&nbsp;We just got out-executed a little bit towards the back end. But we got close.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma is the Player of the Match</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I was quite surprised as well actually. Didn't expect to hit it like that, glad it came off. For the last few months I have been playing like that. The bowlers had something to bowl to and we bowled well. Glad DK could finish well. Been a while since he had some time in the middle. There was this thought if we should get Rishabh in but I thought Sams is going to bowl off-cutters, so I thought let DK come in and he is playing that role anyway for us.\"</p>",

We have a cracking contest ahead of us as this game would be the decider of the series. Both teams would look to emerge victorious and be crowned the winners of the series. The first match was a high-scoring thriller where Hardik Pandya for India and Cameron Green for Australia shined with the bat and the match ended in the favour of the visitors where they chased down the target in the last over. The hosts replied in style in the second match, in the game that was shortened due to rain, with Jasprit Bumrah returning to the XI and our skipper Rohit Sharma leading us from the front. Not a lot to separate these two teams. Let's find out what happens in this blockbuster game.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>The two teams have met each other 25 times and it is Team India that has gotten the better of the opposition.

It's another good batting surface, the grass has been well rolled. Dew wouldn't be a factor tonight, but the captain winning the toss could still be looking at chasing down the score.

Australia has always been challenging, they bring in a different kind of challenge. We need to keep doing the basics right if we have to get success.

India emerge victorious in this series after India win the nail-biting game by 6 wickets, in the last over! Australia started the game in a very hasty manner with Cam Green starting the innings with 52 off just 21. Then the spinners were introduced into the attack who did their job very well and stabilized the innings. Then Tim David finished the innings in style with a quick-fired 54 off 27 and helped Australia reach an above-par total of 186! As the men in blue walked in to chase, India lost her openers soon but Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav were involved in a match-winning 104-run stand, with each of them scoring a half-century. Hardik Pandya provided the finish that India needed to win the game, as India finished the game with 6 wickets and a ball to spare. India wins the series 2-1.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian captain: </strong></span>\"It was a great occasion.

When you are sitting back and watching all of that happening, you feel nice as a management. Sometimes you can err in doing a lot of things. This is T20 cricket, and the margins of error are very small. I thought we took our chances, we were brave.

South Africa will look to bounce back after their dismal performance where they lost 5 wickets with just 9 runs on board. Deepak Chahar and Arshdeep Singh ran through the batting order and there was no answer to their fine swing bowling.Looking at the batting side of things, KL took charge to steady the ship while Suryakumar Yadav led the onslaught from the other end to take India home with ease. India lead the 3 game series 1-0 and will look to clinch the series today itself while Temba Bavuma's men will fight to stay alive in the series.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Ajit Agarkar and Murali Kartik: </strong>\"Only the third T20I played here. There have been low-scoring games here and the average score is 145. There are a few cracks and the groundstaff have left a bit of grass as well. It looks very dry as well. Bowling first would be an advantage and might get easier for batting in the second innings.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>South Africa won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\">Temba Bavuma, South Africa Captain:</span> \"</strong>We are gonna bowl first, manage our energies really well. This one looks like a different pitch. We want to do the job with the ball and then the batters to finish it off. We had a few positives from the first game. Just one change. Ngidi comes in for Shamsi\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain:</strong></span> \"Yes we would have fielded as well. Just want to come out, play some good cricket and entertain the crowd. We have never beaten these guys here and it's gonna take a lot of effort from everyone to do that and we have come out prepared and pretty much ready for the game. Not too sure how the conditions will be. When I touched the pitch there was some stickiness and we gotta be a little cautious at the start.\"</p>",

KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma added 96 for the first wicket and that set the platform for the other batters to follow. Thereafter, it was Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav's turn to take charge. The duo added 102 runs off just 42 balls taking the match away from the opposition. Yadav's 61 of 22 balls with vital contributions from the top order helped India put up a huge total of 237 on board. In response, the African batters struggled against the new ball bowling of Arshdeep Singh and Deepak Chahar which set the momentum in India's favor. But an onslaught from Miller and QDK in the latter half of the innings brought South Africa back in the game. They managed to put up 174 off just 84 balls between them but fell short by 16 runs in the end. India takes an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series and will look to continue the winning momentum at Holkar stadium in Indore.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Temba Bavuma, South African Captain</strong></span>: \"It probably wasn't our best performance with the ball. Different conditions and different plans were needed. Execution of our plans is where our conversation is going to be. With 220, we were thinking as batters would be good. But 240 was too high. It shows why David Miller is one of the best T20 batters going around. He is looking good, feeling good and we can draw a lot of confidence from his performance today.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian captain:</strong></span> \"It is something that all of came together and said was what we wanted to do as a team. It might not come across at times, but we want to stick to it. What I have seen in the last 8-10 months is individuals putting their hand up and getting the job done for the team. Guys without too much experience did this as well. The team wants to play and bowl in a certain way and we want to give them that confidence\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p>\" It is important as an opener to understand what is required on a day and give it your best. It is the mindset I have always played in and will continue to do the same. Satisfying to test yourself in different conditions. Quite honestly, after the first two overs, the chat between me and Rohit was that the pitch was gripping. We thought 180-185 would be a good target. But the game surprises us. I am surpirsed I am getting the Man of the Match award, Surya should have gotten it.\"</p>",

India put up a humongous total of 237 courtesy of some expressive batting from the likes of Suryakumar Yadav, and KL Rahul. Virat Kohli coming back to form is a big plus for the side ahead of the global tournament end of the month. Now that the series is in the bag already, Men in Blue will focus on filling the void of their pace ace Jasprit Bumrah who has been ruled out of the T20 World Cup. With Virat Kohli and KL Rahul rested, Shreyas Iyer walks into the side and we might see some new face in the bowling attack too.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Ajit Agarkar and Pommie Mbangwa:</strong> \"First thing to draw your attention to, it's a small stadium. 63 metres in the off side, 60 metres on the leg side. It's always a good pitch in Indore, this is one of the surfaces where the bowler's wouldn't want to bowl at. There are a few cracks that could help them, but the size of the ground is a worry. Even a few mishits could end up out of the ground.

It's a very high-scoring ground, I feel the pitch won't change a lot so nice to know what target is in front of us. Three changes for us, Kohli and KL are out, and Arshdeep misses out for some issues with his back. It is precautiounary, nothing serious. We've got Shreyas Iyer, Umesh Yadav and Siraj in.<strong>\"</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Temba Bavuma, South African Captain: </strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>\"</strong></span>Wasn't too sure on what to do today, not too fussed about losing the toss.

One can expect rain to play spoilsport in the first ODI scheduled to take place at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium, Lucknow. After suffering a defeat in the T20 series, Temba Bavuma and his men would be looking to gain some winning momentum before the T20 world cup which is about to begin in less than 3 weeks' time. They will also look to capitalize on the fact that India will field a relatively inexperienced lot as most of the players have already flown to Australia for T20 WC preparations. But this side under the leadership of Shikhar Dhawan has played together before and showed their mettle in tough situations. The team is no short of talent and it would not be wrong to say that the players are waiting for opportunities to express themselves in the middle. Indian Squad has included a lot of new faces like Rahul Tripathi, Rajat Patidar, Mukesh Kumar, Ruturaj Gaikwad and Shahbaz Ahmed who might get a chance to debut for India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Revised Rules: It is a curtailed game with 40 overs a side. The powerplay will be between overs 1 to 8. A bowler is allowed to bowl a maximum of 8 overs.</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>India and South Africa have faced each other on 87 occasions in ODI. Out of which, Men in blue have won 35 games whereas the visitors have come out victorious 49 times.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, India Captain:</strong></span> \"We would like to field first. There is a bit of moisture on the wicket and we want to exploit that. We got 6 batters and 5 bowlers playing. Ruturaj is making his debut today. 2 spinners and 3 pacers\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Temba Bavuma, South African Captain</strong></span>:\"We would have liked to bowl first as well. We have a job to do with the bat and we need to adapt accordingly after the first few overs. You gotta be able to adapt to different formats quickly and we still want to keep those T20 skills in check. Every game for us is a big opportunity. \"</p>",

Nonstop rain in Lucknow had the match reduced to 40 overs a side. After winning the toss and electing to bowl first, the Indian bowling unit was great as they dismissed the top order for 110 runs! It was the match-winning unbeaten partnership between Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller of 139 runs that took South Africa to 249, setting a target of 250 for the men in blue in 40 overs! In reply, South Africa contained the Indian top order for a score of 51 runs in 17.4 overs with the loss of 4 wickets! With a Herculian task ahead, Shreyas Iyer and Sanju Samson got going. Iyer was dismissed at 50, after which Shardul and Samson put up a 93 runs stand which brought India much closer but still couldn't achieve the given target. Sanju Samson was unbeaten on 86 while Lungi Ngidi was the pick of the South African bowlers who clinched 3 wickets! The visitors lead the 3-match series 1-0.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, India Captain:</strong></span> \"Very proud of the way the boys played. It's tremendous the way Shreyas, Samson and Shardul played. I thought 250 was too many runs, because the wicket had turn and seam. It'll be a good experience and learning for the young boys\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Temba Bavuma, South Africa Captain:</strong></span> \"A good fight at the end, obviously Sanju pushed us at the end, but the boys stood firm and took us to the win. There wasn't much grass on the surface, we lost a couple of wickets in the middle overs, myself and Aiden, but the boys knuckled down. Miller and Klaasen played positively, stung together a partnership and took us to a good score. Bowling upfront was good, in the first 15 overs by KG and Parnell. I thought we lost our way in the middle overs, gave away far too many runs, but in the end, the result did go our way and I'm happy with that.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Heinrich Klaasen is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Heinrich Klaasen</strong></span>: \"The ball was moving a lot and was spinning just before I walked out to the middle. But we have worked hard in the nets, I do have a good record against India and looking forward to the rest of the games.\"</p>",

India started off good with the ball but Reeza Hendricks and Aiden Markram put up a great stand of 129 runs with Aiden Markram scoring 79 and Reeza Hendricks scoring 74. But the Indians came back stronger with the ball by restricting South Africa to 278 by only conceding 57 runs in the last 10 overs with just 4 boundaries. South Africa started off well by picking up 2 early wickets but Shreyas Iyer and local boy Ishan Kishan built a match-winning partnership of 161 runs. Ishan Kishan was dismissed right before he could score a ton, after which Shreyas Iyer and Sanju Samson successfully chased the target in 45.5 overs. The series is now evenly poised as India equalized today. The 3RD ODI in Delhi will be the decider.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Keshav Maharaj, South African Captain:</strong></span> \"I think we didn't expect the dew to play such a big part, that's why we opted to bat after we won the toss.

Thanks to Keshav that he chose to bat. I must say that Ishan and Shreyas, the way they created that partnership was great to watch. The ball was coming on nicely but it was keeping low. So our plan was to take on the bowlers in the first ten overs. But once the dew came into the picture, it was skidding on. So the back-foot shots were easy to execute. I am very pleased with the bowlers, especially Shahbaz, the way he bowled in the first ten overs and got us the breakthrough.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer is the man of the match!</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer: </strong></span>\"When I went into bat, felt that the wicket was playing good. The talk between me and Ishan was to play the ball on merit, and build a partnership. Tomorrow is going to be a travel day, and then the match. Let's see what is in store for me. I'm not someone who changes according to the bowler. I am someone who changes on instinct and believing in myself.\"</p>",

After a convincing win in the previous encounter, the series stands at 1-1 and both teams would be looking to take the series home. South Africa would be eyeing those precious points for the ICC Men's Cricket world cup super league. Both teams would look to emerge victorious and be crowned the winner. Shreyas Iyer and Sanju Samson have been in good touch in this series and would be wanting to continue their good form in this decider. After a crunch contest in the first ODI South Africa came out victorious and the Indians replied in style during the second encounter. Not a lot to separate these two teams. Let's head to this ODI and find out what happens in this blockbuster.</p><p><strong>So, South Africa have a new captain for every encounter in this ODI series.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#3498db\"><strong>India won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#3498db\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, India Captain:&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>\"</strong>I feel there is some moisture on the wicket and we would want to explore that.

South Africa were outplayed comfortably today. It seemed a damp wicket and South Africa were put to bat first. Siraj struck early and then the spinners continued to do the damage. Klaasen did well to hold one end up but he fell as well. South Africa in the end were bundled out for 99, thanks to the spinners who picked up 8 out of the 10 wickets, with Siraj picking up the other 2. The men in blue chased the given target in just 19.1 overs, with ease. The series started off on a close note before India widened the gap on South Africa.

I am enjoying the journey, I'll try to keep performing well for my team. The boys showed great character on such tough batting pitches. The bowlers were clinical today.</div>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and Welcome to the Live Commentary of the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 super 12 fixture between India and Pakistan happening at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.The biggest rivalry and the most awaited game of the year. Both India and Pakistan will look to kickstart their world cup campaigns with a win. India almost always had the last laugh in World Cup fixtures against Pakistan, winning <strong>12 out of 13 games</strong> against them in World Cups across all formats and winning <strong>5 out of 6 in ICC World Cup T20</strong>. However, Pakistan got the better of the men in blue in the most recent World Cup game that happened between these two nations, and the men in blue would definitely be looking to avenge that, as the wounds are still raw. <strong>King Kohli averages 67.7 in 9 T20Is against Pakistan, scoring 3 fifties in 4 T20 World Cup encounters. He also averages 64.4 in Australia, with a strike rate of 144.6.</strong> Like always, he will have all eyes on him today. Regardless of the result, with 100,000 fans watching from the stadium and almost the whole world watching the game from their homes, we have an absolute blockbuster ahead of us!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>India and Pakistan have faced each other on 11 occasions in T20I. Out of which, Men in blue have won 8 games whereas Pakistan have come out victorious thrice.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India have won the toss and have opted to field first</strong></span></p><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian captain: </strong></span>\"Looks like a good pitch, it's always nice to bowl with overcast conditions. Think the ball will swing around a bit, and we need to take advantage. Preparations have been good. We played a couple of practice games in Brisbane. Time to come out and enjoy ourselves now. We were expecting nothing less than this, hopefully, we'll entertain the crowd. We have seven batters, three seamers, and two spinners.\"</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong></span> \"We would have liked to bowl first as well. We'll try to post around 160-170. We have prepared well, and we are ready for this big game. We had a T20 series back home and we played a tri-series in New Zealand with similar conditions, so we are prepared. We have three fast bowlers and two spinners.\"</div>",

Cometh the hour, Cometh the man. Knocks like this are the foundation of becoming a legend! When India needed 48 runs off 3 overs in a fairly low-scoring game and yet, amidst the chaos, 1.38 billion people had hope. Why? Because of Virat \"King\" Kohli, who played one of the greatest T20 knocks ever! 1.38 billion people can go to bed peacefully because of this man's brilliance today! On behalf of the whole nation, THANK YOU!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>India wins a nail-biting thriller by 4 wickets and kickstarts this World Cup campaign with a victory against Pakistan, at Melbourne. After winning the toss and choosing to bowl first, the men in blue started off the innings strong by dismissing both the openers for single figures but Pakistan came back strong when Ahmed (51 off 34) and Masood (52* off 42) fought back with a partnership. However, after the dismissal of Iftikhar Ahmed, wickets started tumbling again and Pakistan ended up with 159 runs on the board for the fall of 8 wickets, with Hardik and Arshdeep picking up 3 wickets each. Coming in to bat, to chase 160, the men in blue did not have the start that they would have desired as they were 31/4 right after the powerplay! Then Kohli and Pandya kept India alive with their 113 run stand, which was broken only in the last over. And after a dramatic last over, India won the thrilling contest and registered yet another World Cup win over rivals Pakistan, thanks to Kohli's heroics.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong></span> \"A tight game. We started well in our bowling, and then all credit to Hardik Pandya and Virat Kohli. They shifted the momentum and finished the game well. It's not easy with the new ball, with a little bit of swing and seam. We had a chance, and we just asked the boys to believe in themselves, but again credit to Virat Kohli. We needed a wicket, that's why we utilized our main bowlers [and kept Nawaz for the end]. A lot of positives. The way Iftikhar played, the way Shan played and finished the innings was good for us.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian captain:</strong></span> \"I have no voice left. We were always wanting to make sure we stayed in the game as long as possible. We've been talking constantly about it. No matter what the situation, you've got to believe you can pull through, and that partnership changed the game for us. There was good carry, and good swing as well, and we utilized that well upfront. That was good to see from the bowling perspective. They batted well in the middle. We knew it would not be an easy target on that pitch. We knew we would have to bat out of our skins. Virat and Hardik are experienced guys. Staying calm and taking it as deep as possible was critical, and they did that. It's good for our confidence to get off the mark in our first game, and the way we won is more pleasing for us, the way we came back. Hats off to Virat. It has to go off as not one of his best, but the best innings he has played for India.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli:</strong></span> \"I honestly am out of words. Hardik kept telling me, just believe we can stay till the end. I'm lost for words. Well, I think when Shaheen bowled from the Pavilion end, I told Hardik we have to take him down. The calculation was simple. Nawaz had one over to bowl, so if I could take Haris down, they would panic. It came down to 16 off 6. I'm kind of lost for words. The sixes off Rauf was just instinctively. I saw it, told myself to stay still. The one at long-on was unexpected, it was a back-of-a-length slower ball. The fine leg one, I just threw my bat at it. Till today I said Mohali was my best T20 innings. Then I got 82 off 52, today I got 82 off 53. Both are just as special.\"</p>",

After winning the toss and electing to bat first, the Indian skipper Rohit Sharma scored 53 runs after which Virat Kohli scored his back-to-back fifties today. The match-winning partnership of 95* runs from just 48 balls between Virat (62* off 44) and Suryakumar Yadav (51* off 25) pushed the team to an above par total of 179 runs. With the ball, Bhuvneshwar Kumar started with two maiden overs and the wickets fell from both ends meanwhile.

The situation was very simple, I just had to up the tempo at that time. Very happy with the way things went.

The way those two batters played in the end and took them to 180, it was always going to be tricky. We bowled reasonably well but if you don't get the wickets and with the batting order they have, it was always going to be tough to restrict them. It gets bigger and better, Looking forward to it and hopefully we can put up a better performance.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I thought it was a clinical win. Looking at the way they have qualified for the Super 12s, credit to them. We however always looked to what we can do with ourselves, not bother about the opposition. To be honest, this was a near perfect win. Yes, we played a little slow at the start but that was the conversation between me and Virat, we had to wait on that surface to play the big shots. At the end of the day, it is about keeping the confidence up.\"</p>",

The toss turned down in the favour of India and forced the opposition to bowl first. After India lost their top three batters early, Suryakumar Yadav (68 off 30) started building the innings and took the team to a total of 133 runs. Lungi Ngidi and Wayne Parnell were the top performers with the ball for their side with four and three wickets respectively! In reply, Arshdeep Singh took two early wickets and cooked pressure straight away.

That was a match-winning partnership from Markram and Miller. We were a little poor in the field, we gave so many chances and we weren't clinical. We were just not good enough.

It's a batting unit that's been together for a while. To come through in pressure moments will boost the guys' confidence. The variable bounce assisted us. We backed our execution, fortunately it came off for us. It's important we keep improving and that's exactly what we are doing.\"</span></div>",

        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>That was a nerve-wracking thriller that ended in India's favour! After India was put to bat first by Bangladesh, KL Rahul started steadily and went on to accelerate the innings and scored his half-century. Suryakumar Yadav played a quickfire 30 off 16 along with Virat Kohli who built up the innings beautifully and scored 64* off 44. The total at the end of 20 overs was 184 runs. In the chase, Litton Das (60 off 27) played a crackling innings and the team scored 60 runs in the powerplay, after which the rain interrupted play. The target for Bangladesh was revised due to the delay and it was 151 runs required from 16 overs! The most crucial wicket of Litton was taken by an amazing fielding effort by KL Rahul. The equation started to widen up and the bowlers held their nerve despite the striking of Nurul Hasan (25* off 14) and defended the target.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><strong>Virat Kohli: </strong>\"Pretty close game.

For the last three weeks, it has been full of entertaining cricketing action and there were complete twists and turns. India became the first team to qualify for the semis in group 2 and it has been an incredible campaign for the team. India would look to enter the knockouts with a winning momentum whereas the opponent's Zimbabwe would want to end their campaign with a victory.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It is the 50th T20I match for Rohit Sharma as a captain!</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong></p><p>Both the teams have squared off against each other 7 times in T20Is and India has been victorious on five occasions.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and elected to bat first.</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: </strong></span>\"We will bat first.&nbsp; We just want to bat first and give a chance to our bowlers to defend.

The ball might skid through in the evening under lights. We have two changes, <strong>Wellington and Munyonga are in, </strong>Milton has struggled a bit and we wanted to give Tony a chance. Luke Jongwe has an injury and we wanted the spin of Wellington Masakadza.\"</p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1-6 Overs) :-</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India- 46/1 (7.7 rpo, 4x4, 1x6)</span> || <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Zimbabwe- 28/3 (6.7 rpo, 2x4, 1x6)</span></strong></p><p><strong>Middle Overs (7-15 Overs) :-&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India- 61/3 (6.8 rpo, 3x4, 2x6)&nbsp;</span> || <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Zimbabwe- 76/3 (8.4 rpo, 9x4, 1x6)</span></strong></p><p><strong>Death Overs (16-20 Overs) :-&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India- 79/1 (15.8 rpo, 8x4, 4x6)</span> || <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Zimbabwe- 11/4 (5.0 rpo, 1x4, 0x6)</span></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>A stupendous overall performance from team India claims the victory against Zimbabwe by 71 runs. After winning the toss and electing to bat first, KL Rahul at the top provided an amazing start and scored his consecutive fifty today. Virat Kohli went on to make 26 runs after which the fireworks of the 360 player Suryakumar Yadav were lit. He constructed his innings beautifully and made 61* runs off just 25 balls with a strike rate of 244. With the target of 187 for Zimbabwe, the Indian bowlers started their part with a wicket on the very first delivery. The 60-run partnership between S Raza(34 off 24) and R Burl(35 off 22) was the highlight of their innings but then the Bowlers of India dismissed all their batters within the18th over. Ashwin was the highest wicket-taker with three wickets in the second innings.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav:</strong>&nbsp;\"I think the plan was very clear when I and Hardik were batting together. He said we should take a positive route and we started hitting the ball and never stopped. My plan has always been clear, I do the same thing in the nets, I practice the same shots. I bat according to the situation and what the team needs. It's good to see people come out, let's see how it goes in the next game.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Craig Ervine, Zimbabwe Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We could have changed a couple of plans, Surya did extremely well in the back end and countered Richie's wide yorkers. He came out and changed the game. Leading into the tournament, we had some positiveness with the bat. Last couple of games, we went away from that fearless cricket and we went into a shell.We did good work to get into the Super 12s. We'll be building on that. The boys fought really hard throughout the World Cup.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"It was a good all-round performance, something that we were looking for. Before the game, we were qualified but was important to come out and play the way we wanted to play. What SKY's doing for the team is remarkable. Playing and taking pressure off others it's quite important.This is something we expect from him. The key for us will be to adjust to the conditions as quickly as possible. We've played a game there but England will be a good challenge for us. Two teams going at each other, it'll be a great contest. We need to play well. If we do play well, we have a good game ahead as well. The fans have been brilliant, coming and watching us. Hats off to them, on behalf of the team I want to thank them.\"</p>",

It has been an amazing journey for both teams to step into the knockout stages. India won four matches out of the five they played and it is the maximum number of wins by a team in both the groups of the Super 12 stage. However, it all has come here for today where the team which wins will face Pakistan on Sunday in the grand finale. This is going to be a nerve-wracking thriller here and let us wait and watch the exciting match.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>A total of six matches have been played here at this venue in T20 WC this year and four have been won by the teams defending the target and two by the teams chasing. <strong>157 is the average score</strong> here at this venue considering these six matches. India won their only match played here and England plays here for the first time in this T20 WC.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>India and England have squared off against each other 22 times in T20I and India have an edge over the opposition with 12 wins.

We're bang center today and Adelaide Oval is known for long-straight boundaries. And short square boundaries. Looks to be an absolute belter. There is a cover of grass that should help the surface to hold together and the best part is that it's a rock-hard surface. The average score here has been 157 but this looks a high-scoring track.\"&nbsp;</div></div><div>\u00a0</div><div><strong>TOSS:-</strong></div><div><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>England won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Skipper:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span>\"<strong>We will bowl first.</strong>&nbsp;It is a great atmosphere here.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the 2nd match of the T20 series between India and New Zealand at Bay Oval stadium, Mount Maunganui. Right After the ICC T20 WC, the Indian team has toured to New Zealand for a three match T20I and ODI series, where in the 1st T20I rain played as a spoilsport. Both teams will be very keen to go out there and express themselves. Let's just hope the weather gods are considerate but let me tell you there has been a slight downpour today morning. So will this affect the playing 11, will India play 1 spinner or 2 spinners or no spinners at all ? We will have to just wait for the toss and find out the playing combination.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>India and New Zealand have squared off against each other 20 times in T20I and India have an edge over the opposition with 11 wins.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ajay Jadeja: \"Normally it's dry, brown and hard. But there seems to be extra grass on the pitch. So maybe a bit of grip and spin as well with the moisture in there. Pitch is going to stay the same. I think it's a bat first pitch\".</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>New Zealand</strong></span><strong> won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Kane Williamson, NZ Captain</strong>: \"On his decision to bowl, Little bit of both - It's been under covers for a large part, and also potentially some weather around. Adam Milne comes in. Great opportunity for him. Other than that we're unchanged from the last one. Always a great occasion when you get to play against India.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"To get a game, a proper 20-over game, is exciting. We still need to assess the conditions and see how the wicket is behaving. If the wicket doesn't help you, and you try playing shots and lose wickets, and it doesn't rain, you might be in a difficult position. But you have the skillset to cope up with it in international cricket.\"</p><div>\u00a0</div>",

After winning the toss, New Zealand elected to field first. India got off to a decent start with Ishan Kishan being the aggressor as India got to 42 within the powerplay. New Zealand were later greeted with a Surya special where he brought up his 2nd T20I century. Tim Southee too claimed his 2nd T20I hat trick in the last over of the first innings. The New Zealand batters were kept at a hold throughtout the 2nd Innings as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals with Deepak Hooda being the stand out bowler picking up 4 wickets for 10 runs in his 2.5 overs.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>SuryaKumar Yadav is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>SuryaKumar Yadav:</strong> \" The plan was clear when I went into bat. At the 12th/13th over, we thought about batting deep and getting around 170-175 was a par score. Secret (behind his freak shots) is about the intent and you need to enjoy yourself. It's also about the work you do in the practice sessions. It's a great feeling coming here, having a full game and going 1-0 in the series feels good. I feel that I didn't think too much about what was happening. Just had my gameplan and it worked well.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Kane Williamson, New Zealand captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"It was not our best effort. Surya's innings was out of this world. One of the best knocks I've ever seen. Some of those shots, I've never seen before. We didn't get momentum with the ball, didn't get enough wickets and didn't get momentum with the bat either.&nbsp; Again, I'll say about Suryakumar, his innings was the difference. It did swing a bit (in the chase) and India did well to get some swing. Important to look at those few areas and improve. Need to look at the small margins. Surya is the best player in the world.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Can't get any better than this. Everyone chipped it but it was surely a special innings by Surya. We would have taken a score of 170-175. Bowlers did well and everyone had an aggressive mindset. The conditions were very wet, so credit to the bowlers. I have bowled a lot, going forward I want to see more bowling options. Not always that this will work but I want more batters to chip in with the ball. I expect them to be professional, which they are. Give them the opportunity to enjoy themselves. It's about creating an environment where they are all in a happy space. I see many times in this team that all the players are happy for each other's success. And that's important. I'd like to give everyone in the squad a chance but it's just one more game, so it's a bit tough.\"</p><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>\u00a0</div>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the 3rd and final match of the T20 series between India and New Zealand at Napier. So, India lead this T20 series 1-0 after the first match got abandoned at the Sky stadium in Wellington due to rain and India winning the 2nd T20 convincingly at Bay Oval stadium, Mount Maunganui. Just like the previous T20, rain is predicted today too but let's just hope that the weather gods are kind on us and we have a cracker of a game. Kane Williamson is rested for this game so who do you think will lead the Black Caps today? Both teams will be very keen to go out there and have some action, especially India, who would want to finish the series with a clean sweep.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>A total of five matches have been played here at this venue out of which 3 have been won by the chasing team and the average 1st innings score is 171.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ajay Jadeja and Anjum Chopra: \"The pitch has been under covers for the last couple of hours. It looks like a belter, it's a hard pitch and not a lot of moisture in it. Side boundaries are really small. The grass covering is even, so we could expect spongy bounce and that'll help the spinners to grip. The captain winning the toss would want to chase.\"</p><div>\u00a0</div><div><div><strong>TOSS:-</strong></div><div><strong>New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat first!</strong></div><div>\u00a0</div><div><div><strong>Tim Southee, New Zealand Captain:</strong> \"We will bat. Looks like a pitch where we can put the runs on the board. We can't really control the weather, but the history of this ground suggests good batting conditions. Our bowling the other night wasn't the best, but credit to SKY. <strong>Mark Chapman comes in straightaway</strong>. You look back at places where we can improve as a team.\"</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India Captain:</strong></span> \"We wanted to bowl first anyway I think the pitch will remain the same for the entire 40 overs, but with the grass on it, there could be some lateral movement for our pacers. We do keep the dimensions in mind, but we do have the skill-set in our bowling line-up. We can't think too much about the conditions - <strong>One change, Harshal comes in place of Washington Sundar</strong>.\"</div></div></div>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1-6 Overs) :-</strong></p><p><strong>New Zealand- 46/2 (7.7 rpo, 4x4, 2x6)&nbsp;</strong><strong>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India- 58/3 (9.7 rpo, 7x4, 3x6)</span></strong></p><p><strong>Middle Overs (7-15 Overs) :-&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>New Zealand- 83/0 (9.2 rpo, 7x4, 3x6)</strong></p><p><strong>Death Overs (16-20 Overs) :-</strong></p><p><strong>New Zealand- 31/8 (6.2 rpo, 4x4, 0x6)</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The rain gods were kind on us for most part of the day but it started pouring heavily during the 9th over of the 2nd innings and that was it, play had to be stopped and we could not resume as the outfield was too wet to continue according to the umpires. So this match has ended in a tie as India are on par with the DL score, that means India take home this&nbsp; T20 series 1-0. New Zealand and Tim Southee, after winning the toss chose to bat first, which came as a surprise to many. New Zealand lost Finn Allen early but Devon Conway and Mark Chapman did manage to get the hosts off to a decent start but lost Chapman's wicket right on the brink ending the powerplay. Devon Conway and Glenn Phillips had a fantastic partnership in the middle where both batters brought up their 50's but once they were out, it was all India picking up the last 8 wickets within 30 runs, courtesy of Siraj and Arshdeep who cleaned up the NZ batting and picking up 4 wickets each. In retrun, India lost 3 wickets in quick succession but the innings was resurrected by Hardik and Surya. Hardik Pandya and Deepak Hooda were on the crease when the rain took charge of the match.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Tim Southee, New Zealand skipper:</strong> </span>\"It was disappointing even with the bat. We wanted to get out there and and give everything we could, take early wickets. We knew once we take early wickets, anything could happen, but unfortunately the weather came in. You don't know until both sides batted on it, would have been an interesting game but hasn't gone to the full. Little bit of uncertainty around the scoreboard whether it was a tie when the rain came in. Could have gone either way. Nice to be back in some ODI cricket against a quality side like India. Hoping for a good crowd in Auckland.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India skipper:</strong></span> \"Would have liked to win the game by playing the full overs. At some point, I felt attack is the best defence on this wicket. We know the kind of bowling attacks they have, it was very important to get those 10-15 runs extra even though we lost a couple of wickets. A game like this could have given us an opportunity to test some of the players, but having said that, weather is something we cannot control.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammad Siraj is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Mohammad Siraj:</strong></span> \" The wicket wasn't easy to bat and I was prepared to bowl hard lengths which gave me the rewards. I prepared myself to bowl hard lengths and had so much practice during World Cup and I just executed my plans. I always keep it simple. Just bowl the hard lengths. The weather is not in our hands, happy with the series win.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>SuryaKumar Yadav is the player of the series</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>SuryaKumar Yadav:</strong></span> \"Really happy with the way things have gone till now, would have loved a full game here. The pressure is always there and at the same time I'm enjoying my batting, just going there and expressing myself. Not carrying any baggage out there. The intent and approach will remain the same. We can just go out and express ourselves, would have loved a full game, but that's okay.\"</p>",

New Zealand are without Martin Guptill, Trent Boult and Ish Sodhi. It also remains to be seen if Kane Williamson, who missed the third T20I, will be available for the opening one-dayer. Heavy rains on Thursday would leave the outfield significantly wet. Even as a lot of rain isn't expected on the match day, cloudy conditions are likely to be on offer. India on the other hand, will be without Hardik Pandya, who is set to miss the ODI series where Shikhar Dhawan is expected to take lead. India would be looking forward to start the ODI series with a win given their convincing series win over the Black Caps in the T20I series. What action have both the teams have for us, we will just have to wait and watch.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></span></p><p>India and New Zealand have faced each other 110 times in ODI and India have an edge over the opposition with 55 wins and the New Zealand winning 49 of those.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></span></p><p>A total of 79 matches have been played here at this venue out of which 44 have been won by the chasing team and 30 have been won by the team batting first.

It's been under covers for more than a day. We see an even covering of grass. The surface might dry up as the game progresses. There's something in it for the seamers.

New surface here. Most teams will have a lot of ODI cricket now. Each game is an opportunity to build as a side. It is unique, there has been a number fantastic games here. The guys are looking forward to this series. We are going with 4 seamers, a slightly different attack given that Neesham has a niggle - Lockie, Milne, Southee and Matt Henry - along with Santner.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, India Captain:</strong></span> \"It's an amazing place, I enjoy playing over here. No issues batting first, I would loved to have bowled first as well. I feel the wicket is a bit sticky but the sun is out and it should dry out soon. With this team, we have played a few series earlier as well. It's a good opportunity for all the youngsters to perform and show their talents. We are very fortunate that we've got Indians all over the world and they keep supporting us, we are grateful for it. Arshdeep Singh and Umran Malik will be making their debut today.\"</p>",

The rain wasn't a factor in this ODI like all the T20's. So after winning the toss, Kane Williamson elected to field first and India got off to a brilliant start with Dhawan and Gill sharing their 4th century stand. Later, Shreyas Iyer and Sanju Samson steadied the innings and were set for a grand finish when Sanju perished. Washington Sundar made sure India surpassed the 300 run mark with his brilliant finish. With the ball in hand, India rocked the hosts down to 88/3 when in walked Tom Latham and then onwards it was just an excellent display of batsmanship by Latham and Williamson. The partnership between them was 221*. In the previous 6 encounter between India and New Zealand in the ODI format, NZ has won 5 of them and 1 match ended as a tie due to rain. this was New Zealand's 13th consecutive wins in ODI at home, their longest run. We will see you next on the 27th where these two teams will face off in the 2nd ODI at Hamilton. Until then, goodbye and have a great time.</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Tom Latham is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Tom Latham:</span></strong> \"It was just one of those days when everything came off well. Built a partnership with Kane and had a bit of fun. It's about being in strong positions and react to what they were bowling. Was able to find the gaps. The preparation has been ideal, it's been nice and was able to hit the ball right today. Sundar was getting some turn, found a bit hard to play against him. It's a small ground and we could capitalize at the end.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, India Captain:</strong></span> \"We felt good about the total. First 10-15 overs the ball did a lot. Today we've bowled short of length and Latham attacked us there. That's where he took the game away from us especially in the 40th over. Really enjoy playing here. Would've been happier if we won but that's part and parcel. They're all young boys and lots of learning for them. Bowling side and fielding side as well (what areas need improvement?). We need to implement our plans more wisely and make sure we don't make the batsmen play on their strength.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Kane Williamson, New Zealand Captain:</strong></span> \"At the halfway stage I thought it was a competitive total. The wicket was starting to turn a bit. But as we know on this ground if you build partnerships you can chase anything. Incredible knock by Latham. We're talking in the middle about getting through this over and that over. And then he just flicked a switch. Incredible innings. On this ground with the drop-in pitch, if you bowl nice and straight, it can be hard to get the ball away a little bit. It was an over or two where he flicked a switch. We got that big over and he just kept going. One of the more special ODI knocks I've seen. It was a very good wicket. It was nice to make a contribution.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the 2nd out of the 3 ODI matches to be played in this series. We are here at the Eden Park at Seddon Park in Hamilton. New Zealand would be pretty confident going into this match after an amazing batting effort by them in the 1st ODI to chase down a 300+ run mark with ease. India would be wanting to cut loose and get a win to their name. We have a mixed weather forecast for the day with rain and sun gracing out present. New Zealand are expected to play with the same side as they looked very balanced in their previous clash. James Neesham who had a slight niggle during the 1st ODI is expected to be ready for selection for this ODI. As with India, we will have to wait and watch if they will have any changes in thier XI as they went in with just 5 bowling option in the 1st ODI which proved them costly. New Zealand are on a red-hot winning form in ODIs at home and they would like one more tonight to nip out a series win against a side they haven't lost against since the 2019 World Cup. Seddon Park is usually a high-scoring venue and India will be well aware of that fact before devising their bowling plans. Let us wait for the toss to see the combination both these teams will be playing with.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></span></p><p>A total of 46 matches have been played here at this venue out of which 26 have been won by the chasing team and 18 have been won by the team batting first. The average 1st innings score is 239 and the average 2nd innings score is 210.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Update from Hamilton:</strong></span></p><p>Toss delayed by 10 minutes &amp; will take place at 02.10 PM (Local Time) - 06.40 AM IST.&nbsp;</p><p>No change in scheduled start of play - 02.30 PM (Local Time) - 07.00 AM IST.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Ajay Jadeja and Ashish Nehra: \"It's a drop-in surface once again. Looks like a very hard deck, can sense 300 again. Maybe a little bit of moisture early because the covers have just come off. It's a good wicket and unlike start-stop nature of this surface, there's enough covering of grass which means it could come on nicely onto the bat. Win the toss and bowl first, I reckon.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>TOSS:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>New Zealand won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Kane Williamson, New Zealand Captain: </strong>\"We are gonna have a bowl. The surface has been under covers a little, so hopefully our seamers can extract whatever little help they can get. </span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>We are playing the extra spinner today in Michael Bracewell in place of Adam Milne.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"> Southee is racking up the numbers in all formats and breaking a few records along the way, great achievement and a very special player for us. India batted well and got a competitive total on that surface, but I certainly liked the intent from the bowling attack, so hopefully we can start strong again and build on from the last performance.\"</span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, India Captain:</strong></span> \"We would have bowled first as there's moisture in the wicket. Even in the last game, the wicket was seaming for the first 10-15 overs, we got to keep the positive intent and go for the runs. <strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">We have 2 changes today. Deepak Chahar comes in, in place of Shardul Thakur and Deepak Hooda comes in, in place of Sanju Samson.</span></strong> We only need 10 percent of improvement and it makes a huge impact and especially in the death bowling, we got to be a bit more smart this time.\"</p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>It was shaping up to be an interesting match but then, nature had it's say. Pity we could not get a game today. But this was always on the cards as we had rain predictions for today. There were 12.5 overs possible today and Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav gave a good account of themselves despite the surface aiding pace and swing. Surya struck three sixes in his 25-ball 34, while Gill remained unbeaten on 45 off 42. As much as highlights go, that's all we have for you today with rain frustrating all the way. So, India cannot win the series anymore. All to play for to draw this series for India in Hagley oval at Christchurch on the 30th where the teams will lock horns for the last time in this series. Until then, cheer and goodbye.&nbsp;</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and a warm welcome to the live commentary of the first Test between India and Bangladesh at Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium, Chattogram. We are back with the red ball after five long months as India played their last test against England in July. These points are crucial for the teams as this would be considered for the World Test Championship. After an ODI series loss against Bangladesh, the Indian team would want to maintain their winning Test record against the opponent while Bangladesh would want to continue their momentum and register their first Test victory against India!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and elected to bat first!</strong></span></p><div>\u00a0</div><div><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>Both the teams have played 11 Tests against each other and India has a great record as they won 9 matches and the remaining two ended in a draw.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Since 2018, Six Test matches have been played here and all the teams have chosen to bat first. The results are equal as the teams batting first and bowling first have won two each and the remaining two matches have been drawn.&nbsp;</p></div><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Sanjay Manjrekar:</strong> \" I am Surprised with the look of this pitch. There's a decent covering of grass, not to be confused with a green top. That's to ensure that the cracks don't get bigger. India will likely play three seamers. There's enough roughness for the spinners to make an impact from day three. Captain winning the toss will want to bat first.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, Indian Captain:</strong></span> \"We will bat first. Looks a good wicket, put runs on the board. There have been a few injuries but that gives opportunities to other guys. <strong>Kuldeep will play,</strong> <strong>there are 3 spinners and two medium pacers.</strong>\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We would have batted first. History says more wickets falls on the first day than the last day. We're playing a Test match after 5 months, but we have prepared well. This is an important series hopefully we can put some WTC points. <strong>We're playing, two seamers, three spinners and seven batters.</strong> \"</p>",

After winning the toss and electing to bat first, the Indian team put up 404 runs in the first innings with Pujara scoring 90 runs off 203 balls and Shreyas Iyer contributing 86 runs. The 92-run partnership between R Ashwin(58 off 113) and Kuldeep Yadav(40 off 114) were crucial to bring up the score. The spinners Taijul Islam and Mehidy Hasan Miraz each picked four wickets and they were the pick of the bowlers. With the ball, the Indian bowlers bowled extremely well and dismissed all the batters for 150 runs with M Rahim being their top scorer scoring 28 runs. The Left-arm wristy recorded his third fifer.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>India got the privilege to impose follow on but the team opted to bat again and the prodigy Shubman Gill proved his worth in the team by constructing his maiden Test Hundred along with Pujara(who fell short of scoring a century in the first innings) as he registered his quickest Test ton! With a huge target of 513 runs, the Bangladesh openers N H Shanto(67 off 156) and Zakir Hasan(100 off 224) provided a solid start partnering for 124 runs. The Indian bowlers came back in after breaking the partnership and took wickets at regular intervals. With the match heading to the final day, Bangladesh needed 241 runs with still four wickets remaining. Their skipper Shakib Al Hasan fought hard striking 84 runs but it was the Indian bowlers who took authority and bowled out the opposition. Axar Patel was the pick of the bowlers in the second innings as he dismissed four batters!</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India wins the match with a margin of 188 runs and heads to the final Test on 22nd Dec!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh Skipper:</strong></span> \"It was a really good wicket to bat on but we didn't bat well in the first innings. Lot of credit to India for the way they bowled. They bowled in partnerships and created pressure. Zakir Hasan has been scoring a lot of runs in domestic runs, that's why we picked him. Hopefully, he scores a lot more centuries for Bangladesh. We have to play good cricket for all five days. We have to play four good innings to be able to get a result, especially against India.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Kuldeep Yadav is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Kuldeep Yadav:</strong></span> \"To be honest I am happy with the performance, both with bat and ball. There was some pace in the first innings, but the second innings was very challenging. It was slower. so I was trying to work on my rhythm and bowled quicker. Probably more revs on the ball make it challenging for the batters and it is difficult to step down and drive as well. The action is the same, just trying to be aggressive in the rhythm.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, Indian Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Hard-fought Test match and we had to really work hard for this win. Really happy we did that. It did flatten out, didn't worry us. Looked like the batters were batting comfortably. Getting runs was hard for the first three days. The way their openers batted, we had to work hard. Our intensity was really high. We batted well in the first innings as well. It was a job well done by Shreyas and Puji, even Pant's counter-attack. Very pleased with the way we bowled. The pitch wasn't really assisting the bowlers, but they found something. Umesh bowled a couple of great spells and brought us back into the game. I am not going to worry about what we could have done better.\"</p>",

On the second day, it was all about Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer, who scored fifties and stitched up a 159-run partnership to help India take a sizable lead of 87 runs, after which India continued their brilliant display with the ball picking up 10 wickets in a day again and bundling out Bangladesh for 231. With a target of 145, India were in a spot of bother losing 7 wickets for just 74 runs, but Shreyas Iyer continued his purple patch with the bat and put on a 71* run partnership with Ashwin for the 8th wicket, taking India past the finish line and <strong>maintain their unbeaten record against Bangladesh in Tests!</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh captain:</strong></span> \"Everyone contributed.

We can think of several ifs and buts, but I'm proud of the way we fought.

It was a matter of who played the new ball better, once the ball got softer, it was easier to score runs. We did lose a few more wickets than ideal but we got the job done. Will take the win.

The pitches are quite good here, but I thought the ball got soft really quickly.

I have been working hard on my game. Played a lot of First Class cricket and then worked a lot on my game, that's what helped me score these runs. Sometimes there is enough gap between Test matches, and it helps you prepare. I think playing First Class cricket is really important for improving. You need to be mentally prepared and I believe that if you are strong mentally, and prepare well, you'll be good.\"</p>",

Deepak Hooda(41* off 23) and Axar Patel(31* off 20) fired 61 runs in the death overs with a run rate of 12+ runs and partnered for 68* runs off just 35 balls. This led the team to a decent total of 162 runs. In the second innings, the debutant S Mavi picked two wickets in consecutive overs within the powerplay that cooked pressure on the SL batters (after which he ended his spell with four wickets). The Lankan Skipper D Shanaka constructed 45 runs off just 27 balls along with W Hasaranga(21 off 10) who played a cameo by taking the team nearer to the target.

We are here at Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune after a day's break, and all the Indian guys are geared for the match, as a victory today will claim another bilateral Trophy in the kitty. The New Year has begun well for the Indian cricket team with a young and daring squad under the fresh captaincy of Hardik Pandya. He will look to start his first mission of the year with a victory and can he confirm it today? Meanwhile, the visitors also fought till the end in the first match and lit up the competition. Will the Lankans retaliate tonight and nullify the series for now? What will be the changes seen on the Indian XI as Jitesh Sharma replaces the injured Sanju Samson? Will he debut today? There is a lot to answer, catch up with the live action from 7:00 PM!&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>A total of 20 International and IPL matches have been hosted at this venue since 2018 out of which almost all the teams have opted to chase (except thrice). However, the results have favoured the sides who have Batted first (13 times). The Average score stands at 177 runs. Will the team winning the toss follow the trend or will the Indian team under the brave skipper put themselves in challenging situations as he mentioned?&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Deep Dasgupta:</strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong> </strong></span>\"The Pitch is almost in the center of the square, so no biases to any side. It's nice and firm. Because of the openness of this venue, it's quite windy, which also helps seamers. There's very little dew factor as well. One of those rare venues where you want to bat first\".</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya calls right and India will field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Skipper: </strong></span>\"We will&nbsp;bowl first. Thought that the dew might come later, and the wicket looks good and shouldn't change. Happy with the way we bowled and fielded.

The series is nullified now and the final action heads to the third match on Saturday! After winning the toss, the Indian team put the opposition to bat first. P Nissanka(33 off 35) partnered with K Mendis(52 off 31) for 80 runs. C Asalanka came at number four and put up 37 off just 19 deliveries after which the Lankan Skipper D Shanka lit the fireworks scoring 56* runs off just 22 balls. With a huge target of 207 runs to chase, the Sri Lankan bowlers bowled confidently and dismissed the top three batters of the Indian side for single digits. S Yadav started steadily and accelerated further and scored his 13th T20I fifty and A Patel's maiden T20I fifty came just off 20 deliveries. Their 80 run-stand almost took the team closer but the Sri Lankan bowlers defended the target and won the match by 16 runs!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Both bowling and batting powerplay hurt us.

The Game was set by the openers. Need to play well in the middle order to allow finishers to finish well. It's not the dew factor, it's the skill of Indian batters. They took the game away from us but still, we managed to hold our nerve. Really good to defend the total, especially against India in these conditions.\"</p>",

The series has been amazing and competitive as the first match was won by India closely and the second one was bagged by Sri Lanka. All eyes are on today's match as this will decide the ultimate champion of the bilateral T20I series. India has not lost a bilateral series at home since 2019 and indeed it is a great record, but will the Sri Lankan team beat India and create history by winning their first-ever bilateral series against the hosts in India? Will we see any changes in the playing XI?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Considering the 16 domestic and International matches played at this venue since 2019, 10 times the teams have opted to bat first but the results have favoured the teams(10 times) bowling first. The average score here at this venue is 167.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Deep Dasgupta and Kumar Sangakkara: </strong>\"It's a bigger venue - 66m and 65 m square boundaries, large sized pockets, and a 76m straight boundary. There is a greenish tinge of grass, but that will only allow the ball to come onto the bat nicely. There is a bit of tackiness and the side winning the toss might want to bowl first. It's a good pitch, but don't think it is a high-scoring ground nor is it bouncy and pacy, dew might not be a factor.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and elected bat first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Captain: </strong></span>\"We will bat first. Looks like a good track, the last time we played here, the ball did a bit, we might get more swing in the night. We just need to focus on playing good cricket in this game. We were not at our best in the last game, but we still stretched the match.<strong> No changes for us.</strong>\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lankan Captain:</strong></span> \"We would have batted first as well to set the tone first up.

Axar Patel's quick cameo of 21* runs from just 9 deliveries took the team to a mammoth total of 229 runs. With a huge advantage, the Indian bowlers bowled confidently and took 5 wickets in the middle overs!

If you do that in practice, it gets a little easier while playing the game. There is a lot of hard work involved but it's about doing quality practice sessions. The boundaries behind are like 50-60 meters, so I was targeting them. There are some shots that are pre-determined but you need to have other shots too so that if the bowler changes his plan, you can have an answer.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India Skipper:&nbsp;</strong></span>\"I think SKY has been surprising everyone every inning that he is batting. He is just telling us that batting is so easy. Special mention to Rahul Tripathi - the ball was doing something but he showed great intent. I'm really proud of Axar, the way he is batting down the order and hitting. This will give a lot of confidence to him and the team as well. My motto in life as captain has been that I'll back my players. The way we played in the series is pleasing.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the 1st ODI match of the series between India and Sri Lanka which takes place at Barsapara Cricket Stadium, Guwahati. This is the 1st ODI to be played in India after October last year. With the 2023 ODI World Cup just a few months away, India, being the hosts, would be looking to get a firm grip in the format going forward. Meanwhile, we will have to wait and watch on how Sri Lanka turn up for their next challenge, given that they were quite competitive in the T20 series. Rohit Sharma is fit again and is back to lead the Men in Blue in the ODIs. On paper, India are definitely the heavyweights, especially in home conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>India and Sri Lanka have clashed against each other in 162 ODI matches out of which 93 have been won by India and 57 Have come out in the favour of Sri Lanka. Will India continue their domination against the equally strong Sri Lankan side?&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Deep Dasgupta:</strong> \"It's a venue where batters enjoy as it's a high-scoring venue. The pitch is on the drier side, and there are a few cracks. Dew might come into play tonight. The team fielding second will have a tough time because it will be tough to grip the ball. The pitch looks a good one to bat on, but chasing will be easier here. The Captain winning the toss might elect to bowl first.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka from Sri Lanka calls right and they will field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka Captain:</strong></span> \"We are bowling first. A lot of dew around in the evening so we will have a bowl first. It is a good boost to the way we played the T20s coming into this ODI series. <strong>There are a couple of changes from the T20s, Dunith Wellalage comes in for Maheesh Theekshana and Dilshan Madushanka is making his debut.</strong>\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We would have liked to bowl as well, it's a good challenge. The ground was flooded with dew yesterday. There will be times when we need to bowl under dew, we got to be ready for that with the World Cup around the corner. It's about doing the basics right, it's important to do things differently at times. We need to keep moving in the right direction. Had a great time playing an ODI here last time, hope we'll have another memorable game today.<strong> The team setup is&nbsp;- myself and Gill are opening. Virat, Shreyas, KL, Hardik and Axar in the middle and lower order. Three seamers in Shami, Umran and Siraj.</strong>\"</p>",

After being put to bat first, the openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill set the momentum with a 143-run stand! After Rohit and Gill got out for 83 and 70 runs respectively, it was Virat Koli who set the stage on fire scoring consecutive centuries. KL Rahul contributed 39 runs off 29 deliveries and India put up a huge total of 373 runs on board! Kasun Rajitha accounted for three wickets but was also the most expensive bowler. In reply, P Nissanka(72 off 80) right at the top held one end despite the Indian bowlers kept striking early. Dhananjaya De Silva scored 47 runs and the Sri Lankan Skipper constructed a ton (108* off 88) but the huge total made the difference and Sri Lanka was 67 runs short of it! Umran Malik was the pick of the bowlers as he took three wickets!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lankan Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I think the start their openers gave, we didn't use the new ball well, unlike their bowlers who got it to swing. We did have a plan, but the bowlers didn't execute the basics right. We didn't use variations during the first 10 overs. I think I'm doing the basics well, I think I should bat higher in the T20Is, but the team needs me to bat at 6.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We started off well with the bat, it was a great effort from all batters. The platform was set for all the batters, I thought we could have bowled better. Don't want to be too critical, as the conditions were not easy. It wasn't easy to bowl under the lights especially when dew comes in. Everyone needs to come to the party if you want to win, but we bowled well in upfront. You got to be in the game to take those half-chances. All eleven members need to put in an effort collectively.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Virat Kohli:</span>&nbsp;\"</strong>I don't think there was anything different. My preparation and intent always remain the same. I thought I was hitting the ball nicely. I tried to understand the conditions in the second half. Tried to get a comfortable total for us on the board. The one thing I learnt was desperation doesn't get you anywhere. You do not need to complicate things. You go out there and play without any fear, I can't hold on to things. I am in a happy mind and enjoy playing here\"</p>",

In a quick recap of what happened in the first ODI, the Rohit Sharma-led Indian team performed well with Virat Kohli registering consecutive centuries and putting up a huge score of 373 runs. Dasun Shanaka retaliated with a century but the Indian team restricted the team and won the match by 63 runs. With still two matches on the cards, will the Indian team seal the series with a victory here or will Sri Lanka take the series result to the final one like the recently ended T20 Series between the duo?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>In the 21 List A and ODI matches played here since 2017, most of the times (17) the toss-winning teams have elected to bowl first but in contrast the results have favored 13 times for the teams batting first. The average score here is 253. What will the team that wins the toss would do?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p><p><strong>Deep Dasgupta and Russel Arnold:</strong> \"One of the features of this venue is the lightning-quick outfield. This venue isn't that big which doesn't help the bowling side. Looks like a belter. Hard ground to defend. Batters will love it.

Looks like a good wicket and we want to put the runs on the board. Nothing much has been said to the boys. We need to start well. <strong>Pathum Nissanka and Dishan Madushan are out and Nuwanidu Fernando and Lahiru Kumara are replacing them.\"</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Wanted to bat first because of how we played last time, but looking at this ground, I wanted to field. Overall, improvements are as a team, nothing in particular. What we've done in the past is in the past, we need to look ahead and keep doing better. I love playing here, the crowd is also energetic and that motivates me always. <strong>One forced change for us, Chahal in the last game put in a dive and hasn't recovered well today, so Kuldeep Yadav makes way for him.</strong>\"</p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>The low-scoring thriller comes to an end with India getting the better of the opponents. With this victory, India leads and seals the series. After opting to bat first, the Sri Lankan debutant Nuwanidu Fernando scored his half-century partnering for 73 off 66 with Kusal Mendis who scored 34 runs. As soon as the ball was handed over to Kuldeep Yadav(3-51), he broke the crucial partnership and brought the team into a dominating position with three wickets in his first four overs. After which, the Sri Lankan team couldn't bounce back. In the chase, both the openers started well but Sri Lanka did not allow them to settle. After losing quite a few wickets in quick succession the partnership of 75 runs between Hardik(36 off 53) and Rahul(64* off 103) was valuable. Rahul stayed till the end and guided the team to victory!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka Captain: </strong></span>\"We did not put enough runs on the board. We got a good start with the bat and then lost a few wickets. We discussed that it was a very flat deck. 300 was the score to set, but Kuldeep bowled really well in the middle phase. We had a chance because the ball was moving. I asked the fast bowlers to stick to their basics and move the ball.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"It was a close game but games like these teach you a lot. KL has been batting at five for a long period of time now and it gives us depth. Gives you confidence as well at the top of the order for us to go and bat freely. It was a good display of batsmanship. There are 3 ODIs coming up against New Zealand as well, so we need to keep the guys fresh. We've got a long season now and we need to keep everything in mind. If needed, we'll make some changes. For Kuldeep Yadav to come back and play the game he played today, it was fantastic.

The pitch looks really good, no grass on it, but there could be moisture underneath. Spinners have taken wickets here and there have been low scores in the past. It looks like a good batting track, but in the Vijay Hazare games here five out of eight times the teams were all out. Could be a tricky pitch. If I were Sri Lanka, I would choose to bowl first considering the dew that would come into play during the evening\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India have won the toss and Rohit Sharma has confirmed that the Men in Blue will bat first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma:</strong></span> \"We will bat first. Looks like a good pitch, have to make the most of it. Still a lot of areas we can keep improving, and today gives us a chance to perfect those.

India won the toss and elected to bat first. It looked like a tricky wicket initially but once the openers settled, India never looked back! India put a mammoth total of 390 on board, thanks to the two centurions Virat Kohli (166*) and Shubman Gill (116). Skipper Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer played a good hand as well. Kasun Rajitha and Lahiru Kumara picked two wickets each, but all Sri Lankan bowlers were expensive! Sri Lankan batsmen walked in to bat with a herculean task ahead! Sri Lanka lost 5 wickets in the powerplay, with Siraj picking up 4 wickets for the first time in his ODI career! They lost the remaining wickets in the remaining overs with Kuldeep and Shami picking two each. Sri Lanka were wrapped up for 73 runs and India posted the biggest victory ever in an ODI game. Several records were broken today by the men in blue! The series couldn't have ended on a better note. Next up for the men in blue are the kiwis.&nbsp;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><div><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka captain:</strong></span> \"It's disappointing. Not a game we wanted. It happens. We need to learn how to manage the start. Bowlers should learn how to take wickets on these decks and the batters should learn to score. Playing positive cricket is the more important thing. If the boys show intent, the bowling would have been different. Congratulations to the Indian team for this performance.\"</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India captain:</strong></span> \"I thought it was a great series for us. We bowled pretty well, got wickets, and breakthroughs when we need. Batters throughout the series piling up those runs were good to watch. Was good to see how Siraj was bowling and deserved the slips. The way he is swinging the ball, he is a rare talent. And in the last couple of years, we have seen him go from strength to strength. We tried all sorts of things to help him get five. But the confidence is there and we can see in the way he is running. He is working on a few tricks. Haven't given much thought about New Zealand. We'll get there and see and there will be a change in combination with what we saw today. We want to work as we did in this series to get the result we want.\"</div><div>\u00a0</div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli is the Player of the match and series:</strong></span></div><div><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli:</strong></span> \"It is the by-product of the intent I have. The mindset is to help the team and put the team in a strong position. I have played for the right reasons and that has helped. Ever since I came back from the break, I am feeling good and I don't have the desperation to get to a milestone. I want to continue doing that and am content. Today I was happy to be batting out there and in that space, I end up playing good cricket. I am in a nice space right now, just be organic. Shami has always been there for us with the new ball. But the way Siraj has come in and done with the new ball has been fantastic. He picks wickets in the powerplay, which was an issue in the past. It is a great sign for us heading into the World Cup.\"</div></div><div>\u00a0</div>",

Just after wrapping up the series with a world record for the highest margin of victory in ODI's the Indian team is geared up for a fresh series at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad for the first faceoff here against New Zealand who also comes back strong after a series victory against Pakistan 2-1. There are quite a few changes from the Indian squad and it will be interesting to see who will fit in the final XI. Will the hosts dominate their opposition or will the Blackcaps start their campaign here with a win?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>India has an edge over the opposition with 55 wins out of 113 ODIs while New Zealand has won 50. The previous time the two teams met, New Zealand bagged the series at their home. Will India showcase their supremacy now?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Out of the 15 ODIs and List A matches played at this venue since 2015, the results are neck to neck with 8 matches being won by the teams batting first. 281 is recorded as the average score here. Will the team that wins the toss opt to bat first?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p>Murali Kartik: \"Either side of the square is 63 metres and downtown 70 metres. The pitch looks like a nice straw-coloured surface, light grass but pretty evenly rolled. Batting first or batting second is immaterial. The curator says it's pretty cold in the evenings which is what we saw in the last two days. There's not enough dew to suggest that batting second is an option. It's up to the team's makeup on what they want to do.\"<br /><br /><br /><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma has called it right at the toss and India will bat first.</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain:</strong></span> \"We will bat first.

The toss in this series starter was won by India and they elected to bat first. It was a one-man show from the prodigy Shubman Gill as he continued his form from the previous match and hit consecutive centuries. Yet he was not settled with it and converted it to his highest score and also became the youngest player to score 200. The score at the end of 50 overs was 349 runs. In reply, Finn Allen made 40 runs after which it was all Michael Bracewell's show who fought single-handedly making 140 runs off just 78 deliveries. Mitchell Santner's 57 off 45 was also vital but it was the Indian bowlers who held their nerve and defends the target by 12 runs. The local lad Mohammed Siraj was the pick of the bowlers with four crucial wickets giving just 46 runs in his quota of ten overs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Tom Latham, New Zealand Captain:</strong>&nbsp;\"It was an amazing innings from Bracewell. From 131/6, to come and play an innings like that, for him to put our team in a situation to win the game, it's outstanding. Obviously disappointing we couldn't get across the line but it was special. When you're chasing and coming at a pressure situation, to give us a chance to win that game was special. I think it probably gripped a bit more under lights, India used a lot more cutters into the wicket and it worked.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"To be honest, the way Bracewell was batting and the way it came on to the bat nicely, it was clean ball-striking. We knew that if we bowled well, we would be okay unless we really slipped up with the ball. Unfortunately, that's what happened. I did say at the toss that I'd like to see us challenge ourselves, not quite the situation I expected but that's how it is. Gill is going really well. Siraj has been brilliant, not just in this game but in the red-ball, T20 format and now ODIs. Really good to see what he does with the ball.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill:</strong></span> \"I was waiting eagerly to go out and do what I want to do. With wickets falling, at times I wanted to unleash and I'm glad I could do it at the end. Sometimes when the bowler is on top, you need to make them feel pressure. Need to avoid dot balls, show some intent and hit hard into the gaps. Wasn't really thinking of 200, but once I hit sixes in the 47th over, I did feel that I could. Before that, I was playing what was coming to me. Definitely a sense of satisfaction.\"</p>",

We are still yet to recover from the mind-blowing innings from Shubman Gill who carved his name in the records for being the youngest person to score a double century in ODIs. Will we see another brilliance today or will the other batters step up today? The previous match turned out to be a close one and in the end, it was India who stamped their victory. With still two matches remaining, can the visitors take this down to the final one or will India seal the series?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE FACTS:-</strong></p><p>Venue stats? - Nah! We present you the Venue facts here as Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium at Raipur hosts its first ODI match since its inauguration in 2008. With the first match being held here, this will become the 50th venue in India to host an ODI. This venue also bears the fame of being the third largest ground in India considering its capacity of seating 65000 odd people.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong></p><p><strong>Murali Kartik and Grant Elliot:</strong> \"Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium at Raipur becomes the 50th venue to host an ODI in India. The square and straight down the ground are huge boundaries. The pitch is hard and firm and has an even covering of grass. This will help the seamers with pace and bounce but this pitch is good for the batters too. Dew is a factor here and the team winning the toss will opt to bowl here.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma calls heads and heads it is!&nbsp;India will field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper:</strong></span> \"I forgot what to do as he we had a lot of discussions about the toss. We want to challenge ourselves under tough conditions so we are bowling first. I knew once the lights come on we wanted to bowl more. Michael Bracewell played well and we bowled well to win there.&nbsp; There was a bit of dew during the training sessions, but we've heard from the curator that it will not play a role on game days. We will play with the <strong>same XI</strong>.\"</p><p><strong>Tom Latham, New Zealand Skipper:</strong> \"We would have bowled first as well because it's the first international match here. Not really sure what the wicket will do. It was a great game in the previous one, we were put under pressure but we did well in execution. It is about the new guys getting the experience, we want to improve game by game. Ish Sodhi is not fit and we will<strong> play unchanged</strong>.\"&nbsp;</p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>Another bilateral series and another feather added to the cap! This is the seventh series at a streak that has been bagged by India against the Blackcaps at home. Rohit decided to bowl first and the Indian seamer M Shami(3/18 in 6 overs) provided the team a wicket in the very first over after which each bowler who was given the ball accounted for at least a wicket. The 47-run stand between G Phillips(36 off 52) and M Santner(27 off 39) looked reviving but it was shortlived and the team succumbed to a total of just 108 runs in 34.3 overs! With the bat, the Indian batters Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill did their part and chased the target with overs 29 odd overs remaining.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Tom Latham, New Zealand Captain:</strong> \"Yes, batting up top and losing 5/1 was not a good performance. India was tight in their bowling and they deserve this win. The surface was two-paced with tennis ball bounce. We didn't apply ourselves with the bat. We did not build out a partnership and the score was not enough. We haven't adapted well to the conditions and that's why we lost the series.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain: </strong></span>\"Bowlers have really stepped up today and in the previous games. You don't usually see this type of seam movement in India. These guys have some serious skills, they work really hard and it's great to see them being rewarded. We trained yesterday and the ball was nipping around under lights. We knew that if they had two fifty, it might have been challenging for us but that was the point of opting to chase. We batted first last game, so the idea was to challenge ourselves. I'm trying to change my game a bit now, have been trying to take the bowlers on and I think that's important.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammed Shami is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammed Shami:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I just focus on maintaining the right lines and lengths. But it does happen sometimes that you bowl well and yet don't get wickets. I feel that the more you work with the ball in practice, the more success will come. I never thought I'd get to have a proper seam position and it gives me happiness to see the seam upright as it goes in the air.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and we welcome you to the live commentary of the 3rd and the final ODI match of the series between India and New Zealand at Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore. The first two matches turned in the favour of India and the Indian team registered its seventh consecutive bilateral series victory against the visitors and once again it is clear that the hosts are unbeatable in a bilateral series here. Will we see a clean sweep from India or will the Blackcaps retaliate today and win this match for their pride? Will we see the benched players in action today?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Danny Morrison and Ajit Agarkar:</strong> \" This is not the biggest stadium. Sixty meters on the sides, Sixty nine meters straight, and just fifty-four behind the stumps. It is going to be tough for the bowlers. There is an even covering of grass through the middle of the pitch to hold it together and as the evening progresses, the ball will only skid on. The pitch looks very firm and good for batting. Might hold on a bit in the start of the innings, but it will only keep getting better and it's a batting day.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>New Zealand won the toss and opts to field first!</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Tom Latham, New Zealand Captain:</strong> \"We choose to bowl first. It is a good surface and it will get better under the lights. We have had good performances in the past and will look to play here as well. It will be a high-scoring match and the nature of the boundaries are too short. <strong>Jacob Duffy replaces Henry Shipley.</strong>\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain:</strong></span> \"We will be happy to bat first as this gives us an opportunity to create pressure on the opposition. We want to keep testing ourselves and see what we can do. We are looking to give a game to the other players who didn't get a chance. Whenever we have come here we have got a big score. <strong>We have got two changes. Both the seamers are out. Siraj and Shami are out. Umran and Chahal comes in.</strong>\"</p>",

A pleasing effort from the Indian team and this results in a 90-run margin victory against the opponents. India was forced to bat first and the openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill raced for their centuries and successfully did so. Till the 27th over when the first wicket fell, there were no stoppage of boundaries and the batters were on a roll. The New Zealand bowlers came back with a few wickets and Hardik Pandya finished well with a fifty! With a huge total of 386 runs to chase, the Kiwi opener Finn Allen was dismissed on the very second ball of the innings with a stunner from Hardik. The batting was steadied with the 106-run stand between Henry Nicholls and Devon Conway! Conway made his way all toward his third ODI century and achieved it. But in the end, the target was a huge one and the visitors succumbed within the 42nd over! Shardul Thakur and Kuldeep Yadav were pick of the bowlers with three wickets each!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Tom Latham, New Zealand Captain:</strong> \"The start with the ball was not great but we did well to hold them to 380. And then to be bowled out in 40 overs didn't go right for us. It's our last experience in India before the World Cup so the guys are exposed to these conditions in the three games and hopefully it'll be helpful in October. We're building depth in the squad. Hopefully we can take the learnings for the T20 series.\"</p><div>\u00a0</div><div><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shardul Thakur is the Player of The Match</strong></span></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shardul Thakur:</span></strong>&nbsp;\"I am liked very much by my teammates. All are here to play cricket and the opponents come after you it's important to stay in the moment and go ahead. You got to be ready for different situations. Everyone enjoys batting in the modern day of cricket.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill is the Player of The Series</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Feels nice when you bag the series and when you perform well. I don't think my approach has changed after the double hundred. It's all about getting a start and converting every score. Just being in the situation and looking to score helps convert those starts for me. Our bowlers bowled great on this wicket and happy to be on the winning side.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I thought in the last six games we played we did most part rights and we were consistent - that is the key in this format. We wanted to give chances to people on the bench. We wanted to see how they react under pressure. I don't think any score is safe here. Shardul has been doing it for a while. People call him a magician in the squad. Gill's approach is quite similar. I've been batting well, so it was just about going that extra mile. The pitch was good today and I am very happy with the century.\"</p></div>",

The opening match was sealed by the visitors with a wonderful display of spin bowling. India needs to win this match so that they can null the series and take the final result to the last T20I on February 1. Can Hardik Pandya and the team lead India to another bilateral victory or will the blackcaps claim the series by winning today?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Danny Morrison and Ajit Agarkar:</strong> \" This is one of the bigger grounds in India. 69m square on one side, 67m on the other side and 77m down the ground. It has a tacky look to it and it is a red soil pitch. If there is grip or movement off the pitch it will be quick and the batter will not have time. Team batting second would be hoping for dew.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong>New Zealand wins the toss and goes with the venue trend of batting first!</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Mitchell Santner, New Zealand Captain: </strong>\"We will bat first. Just going with the trend here and so we opt to bat. It was nice to come back after a tough ODI series. Different guys stepping up at different times. It's never easy to beat India at home. There were times when we thought we were ahead of the game but they bounced back with the partnership between Surya and Hardik. <strong>We will play with the same XI</strong>.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We also wanted to bat first but it is fine. This is a fresh team, but we have spoken about getting into the challenge and having to do difficult things. It can't get more difficult than this in a bilateral series, losing the first game and then two games on the line. Looking forward to this game. We all should remember that we started playing this sport to enjoy, so I just want to pass that message to the team. <strong>We have made a change - Chahal comes in place of Umran.</strong>\"</p>",

Going by the advantage of 100% victory by the batting first teams at this venue, the New Zealand skipper opted to do so. The pitch showcased some serious spin-friendly scenes there and all the spinners of the Indian team accounted for a wicket piling up the pressure on Kiwis. Arshdeep Singh was given the ball in the 18th over and he got two scalps. The wicket was too slow and New Zealand could only make 99 runs for the loss of eight wickets in the full quota of 20 overs. The ball spun the same way in the second innings but the Indian batters played sensibly holding the wickets and chasing down the target taking the match to the penultimate ball! Suryakumar Yadav scored well and finished making 26 runs with the skipper Pandya scoring 15.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Mitchell Santner, New Zealand Skipper:</strong>&nbsp;\"It was a great game of cricket. To get it close, it was a great effort from the bowlers. If we'd got a few extra runs that could have made the difference. Surya and Hardik played calmly and got them over the line. With the bounce out there, it looked challenging. 120 would have been a good score here.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Skipper: </strong></span>\"I always believed we will finish the game but it went quite deep. It is important to not panic on such games. We rotated the strike well instead of taking risks. This is a shocker of a pitch. Even 120 would have been a winning total here. We kept to our plans, we made sure they will not rotate the strike. Dew didn't play much of a role.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav:</strong></span> \"Adapting to the situation was very important, so you might have seen a different SKY. I had to make sure I batted till the end. It was a challenging wicket we had to adapt well. We just needed one hit in the end, and it was very important to calm ourselves down. Both of us kept motivating each other and it was helpful.\"</p>",

It has all turned down for today's match after both the teams won one fixture against each other in the series 1-1. With the ODI series being claimed by India, New Zealand would look to go back home with a victory in the T20I series for which they need a win here, while the Indian team would play hard to maintain their Bilateral winning streak. Who will win this final and crucial match?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Six T20I matches have been hosted by this grand venue and the results while batting and bowling first have equally favoured the teams (3)! The average score at the venue is 174 and we could expect a high-scoring thriller tonight!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Danny Morrison and Ajit Agarkar:</strong> \"This is an outstanding ground. 67 meters one side, 71 on the other and 72 down the ground. There have been a couple of pitches where the batters have had to work hard, but this clearly looks good. There might be a few brown spots on the pitch but they will only get better. Because of the nice even covering of grass the ball will come on and as the evening progresses will keep getting better. it is a bowl first pitch considering the dew around.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya wins the toss and opts to bat first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Skipper: </strong></span>\"We'll bat first. Want to put some runs. Looks like a good wicket. Tough on the batters in the last two games, but credit to them for the approach they have shown. This is what as a unit we strive for, we are going to get tested but we will learn from it. These kind of knockout games teach you a lot. We have one change&nbsp; with <strong>Umran Malik coming in for Chahal</strong> as the surface looks to help the pace bowlers.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Mitchell Santner, New Zealand Skipper:</strong> \"We wanted to bowl first. Looks like a good surface. We are up for chasing in this wicket. We have to adapt ourselves to these big boundaries This is my first time at this venue. With the series on the line, I think the boys are really fired up. <strong>Ben Lister replaces Jacob Duffy</strong>.\"</p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>The Indian records in the Bilateral series and in those decider matches have always been tilted on the side of the Indian team and this result is also one which proves the fact. In a crucial decider, where the pitch was said to favour the chasing side, the Indian skipper opted bravely to bat first. After the early wicket of I Kishan, Rahul Tripathi(44 off 22) chipped in and set up the perfect start for a huge total. S Gill stood tall from the others and was unstoppable till the end of his unbeaten knock of 126* off just 63 deliveries. The cameo of 30 runs from just 17 balls from the Indian Skipper Hardik helped the team to post a huge total of 234 runs. With a massive target to chase, the NZ batters tried to attack from the start and once again it was Hardik who opened the bowling with a wicket in the very first over. Arshdeep Singh claimed two scalps in the second over of the match and the batters were cramped. Apart from the double-digit scores of D Mitchell and M Santner, all the other batters were dismissed for single-digit. Hardik Pandya was the pick of the bowlers with four wickets having an economy of just 4.0rpo.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">With this victory, India adds another feather to the cap, and also this match's 168-run margin of victory by India is the highest in T20Is.</span></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Mitchell Santner, New Zealand Captain:</strong>&nbsp;\"It was disappointing definitely but credit to India, they played well. Some of their guys are in great touch at the moment. It is tough to win when you lose five wickets in the powerplay. It can be challenging when the ball is swinging. If you look at the way India played, they took their time early on and when it got flat, they really had a go at us. I guess that time of the year there will be some dew around, most teams might bowl first. We've seen some great wickets, if it is like that in October it will be a great World Cup to be part of and to learn.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill:</strong></span> \"It feels good when you practice and it pays off. I was backing myself to score big. Happy to see it work out now. Everybody has a different technique to hit sixes. Hardik told me to play my game and he kept backing me. It was my dream to play for India, and I am very fortunate to be part of the team in all three formats.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya is the Player of the Series:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India Captain:</strong></span> \"There were so many performances that were exceptional but happy to receive the Man of the Series. I always play the game like this, I try to read what is required, not have preconceived ideas. In my captaincy, I look to keep it simple and back my gut. I have a simple rule If I go down, I will go down on my terms. I wanted to make it a normal game because it was a decider. Hence, we batted first. Hopefully, we can continue performing like this.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the curtain raiser of the mightiest Border-Gavaskar Trophy which is played between the big guns India&nbsp;and Australia&nbsp;The Indian players are back in the whites for the red ball action for the next one month as the series comprises four Tests. There are many factors that make the clash epic but more importantly, the result of the series is vital for the teams to get into the final of the World Test Championship. There are many matchups to lookup for and it would be interesting to see who gets the better of against each other. What will be the first playing XI? Will India go with three spinners? Who will keep wickets for the match? Can India spin their way to victory or will the visitors open the series with a lead here? There is a lot to answer!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Indian team has an edge over the opposition with nine victories in 15 series. The home soil record for India hugely tilts towards the hosts with seven triumphs and Australia has only won one series in 2004.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p>In six Tests played at Nagpur, the teams batting first have won three matches and the teams which bowl first have won twice. The average first innings score at the venue is 324 runs.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sanjay Manjrekar and Matthew Hayden:</strong> &quot;The soil looks pretty rough. There are cracks as well, and they may stay intact. But the real talking point is the rough area. left-hander against the left-arm spinner, it&#39;s going to be a nightmare for them because there is tremendous potential for the left-arm spinner. Check out the tone difference between here on a hard length for fast bowlers and on this danger area the spinning zone. You&#39;ve got rough, you&#39;ve got shaved grass, and it&#39;s ironic that the roller and the grass that was being cut here was just shavings of dust because it&#39;s going to be a turner.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Pat Cummins calls right and Australia will Bat first!&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Pat Cummins, Australian Captain: </strong></span>&quot;We will bat first. Looks like an even wicket in the middle. The preparation went really well in Bangalore. Can&#39;t wait. Two changes for us from the last game we played in Sydney. <strong>Todd Murphy debuts in place of Ashton Agar and Peter Handscomb comes in place of Travis Head.</strong>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain:</strong></span> &quot;We would have batted too&nbsp;but hope we could restrict them as low as possible. Looks pretty dry and there will be help for spinners. We got to wait and see how much it does. We saw some seam movement for the pacers up front yesterday. We have had a good prep for the last 5-6 days. This is a big one. We know the importance of the series but we also understand it&#39;s about winning one session at a time. <strong>We have three spinners, and two-seamers with Bharat and Suryakumar Yadav making their debut.</strong>&quot;</p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Day 1 :&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#d35400\">Australia- 177/10 (63.5 Overs, 2.8 rpo, 27x4, 0x6)</span></strong><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>||<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;India- 77/1 (24 overs, 3.2 rpo, 10x4, 1x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 2 :&nbsp;</strong><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India- 244/6 (90 overs, 2.7 rpo, 30x4, 2x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 3 :&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India- 79/3 (25.3 Overs, 3.1 rpo, 4x4, 4x6) </strong></span><strong>||</strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Australia - 91/10 (32.3 Overs, 2.8 rpo, 13x4, 1x6)</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>India takes a 1-0 lead in the series after an innings victory here in the first test at Nagpur by 132 runs. After opting to bat first, Australia lost both their openers early in the first session to the Indian seamers and then Jadeja starred with the ball, picking up 5 wickets in his comeback, helping India restrict Australia to 177 inside the first day - the visitors lowest total in the 1st innings since 2020. On the second day, Rohit Sharma led from the front and scored a hard-fought century, becoming the first Indian captain to score a century in all the formats, after which 50s from Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel helped India take a huge 1st innings lead of 223 runs. Ashwin took center stage in the 2nd innings, picking up his 31st 5-wkt haul in Tests, bowling out Australia for 91, helping India inch one step closer to the coveted WTC Final. Join us on Friday 17th Feb for the second test of the series!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins, Australia skipper:</strong></span> &quot;The game moves pretty quickly here in India. The Indian spinners are always going to be hard work when it&#39;s spinning and Rohit played very well. The wicket spun in the first innings but it wasn&#39;t unplayable. We were 100 runs short. Starting here is tough but 3-4 of our guys got in. When you do get in, you got to score big scores.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;Very important to start the series with a win. Happy that I could put the performance for the team, happy to be back. Since I was appointed Test captain, had played just two Tests and was ready for this one. In the last few years, with the kind of pitches we are playing in India, you need to have application and some sort of plan to score runs. I&#39;ve grown up playing a lot in Mumbai on surfaces that turn a lot. Need to put pressure on bowlers as well by doing something different. We know we have quality in our spin department. But the seamers can be threatening as well on a pitch like that.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ravindra Jadeja is the Player of the Match</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja:</strong></span> &quot;Feels amazing, when you come back after five months and give your 100 percent, scoring runs and taking wickets. Was working hard at the NCA and would like to thank the NCA staff, and physios. They have been working hard with me, even on Sundays. Ball was spinning, going straight, keeping low and I kept telling myself to bowl at the stumps. I look to keep things simple and try not to change things with my batting.&quot;</p>\n",

India wrapped up the first Test within two and a half days and claimed victory by an innings and 132 runs. Shreyas Iyer is back in the squad for India and will he replace someone straightaway? For Australia, Mitchell Starc is available, and if he plays who will be kept out to make him play? <strong>We have a landmark Alert also where Cheteshwar Pujara is all set to play his 100th Test!</strong> Can India turn the result on their way and lead the series or will the Australian team bounce back here? Will the Test go on till the fifth day? There is a lot to answer and let us await an interesting contest!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>A total of 34 Tests has been played here by India at this stadium of which 13 have been won, 15 being drawn and 6 being lost. Since 1988, India has not lost a Test match here and it won't be too much if we say this is the Fortress for India. The Average first innings score here is 342 runs. Since 2011, the teams batting first have won 1 match and the teams bowling first have been victorious twice with the result being ended on a draw once.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Sanjay Manjrekar and Matthew Hayden:</strong> \"The pitch looks better than the first Test. It is a two-faced pitch that looks good in the center but changes as you come closer to the stumps, that's where the spinners will be effective. It looks like a Day 3 wicket right now with big cracks already. Though the groundsmen say it is unlikely to break up. It is a very dry wicket, so seamers may come into the play early. Pretty good for batting first on Day one.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>\"Tails\" call from Pat Cummins and Tails it is! Australia will Bat first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Pat Cummins, Australian Skipper: </strong></span>\"We are going to bat first and want to put runs on the board. The middle pitch looks like there's grass but it is bare at both ends. Plenty of turn there, will be a good Test. Cameron Green and Mitch Starc aren't playing. <strong>Travis Head comes in for Renshaw, and Matthew Kuhnemann makes his debut in place of Scott Boland.</strong>\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper:</span></strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> </span>\"We wanted to bat first as well. The pitch is dry. You just have to come out and play good cricket, and that has been the chat in the group. We are all thrilled about Pujara's 100th Test and it isn't easy. <strong>We have a change as Shreyas Iyer replaces Suryakumar Yadav.</strong>\"</p>",

To begin with the toss, Australia once again won and elected to bat first. M Shami who ended up picking four wickets gave the initial breakthrough with the wicket of Warner after which the Aussie opener U Khawaja scored 81 runs as he stood in the crease till the 46th over. P Handscomb played a lonely knock of 72* runs in 142 balls. The Spinners Ashwin and Jadeja picked three wickets each and the opposition was all out for 263. The Indian team scored 262 runs and were bundled out in the second innings with the tail-end saviour show of Axar Patel (74 off 115)! Nathan Lyon was the highest wicket-taker with five wickets in this innings! When Australia came to bat, they were leading by a run. It was all the Spin show in the third innings with Jadeja accounting for 7 wickets which is his best figure to date. Apart from the double-digit scores of T Head and M Labuschagne, all the others were dismissed for a single-digit score. With 115 runs to chase, India lost a few wickets but it must be said that this is a comfortable win for the Indian boys!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Pat Cummins, Australian Skipper:</strong></span> \"I thought 260 was a decent score in the first innings. The guys bounced back well. But India batted well. It was all even, in the innings break. We were ahead of the game but we slipped. We need a review of the shot choice and need to work in the room regarding it. Both games were disappointing but this one hurts more. We were ahead in the game and that doesn't happen often in India.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"Fantastic result for us. The way we came back and finished our job was great. I think the bowlers were fantastic, to take 9 wickets today morning is commendable. And then we finished the job with the bat.&nbsp; We were prepared for them to come out and play shots. Our idea was to not panic and just hit the right areas, waiting for the mistake to happen and that's exactly what happened. Our focus was keeping it tight in the morning, and these guys are the masters of bowling in these conditions. There are a lot of game-changing moments across four innings, but I thought the partnership between Jadeja and Virat and then Axar and Ash was brilliant.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja:</strong> </span>\"I was enjoying my bowling. These wickets suited me because the odd ball spins and some stayed low. I knew they would play sweeps and reverse sweeps, so my idea was just to keep it simple and straight to the stumps. I have a chance if they make mistakes.\"</p>",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the Third Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy where India and Australia are squaring off against each other at Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore. India sealed the first two matches comfortably wrapping up the Test matches in just three days. The Australian team will miss their players Pat Cummins, David Warner, Josh Hazelwood, and Ashton Agar for the Test while the team will be led by Steve Smith. This is a must-win game for the visitors to at least take the series to the final Test - where if they win, then the series could be a tie with 2-2. But, will India allow the opposition to get the better of them or will they continue their supreme form? Cameron Green and Mitchel Starc will mostly be back in the action and what will be their playing combination here? Will India change their winning combination or will they continue with the same XI?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p><p>Since 2016, two Tests have been played here and both the times, the teams who have won the toss decided to bat first and the results ended equal with one by batting first and one by bowling first.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Average Scores by innings:</strong></p><p><strong>1st innings - 354</strong></p><p><strong>2nd innings - 396</strong></p><p><strong>3rd innings - 215</strong></p><p>Only domestic multi-day matches were held here recently (Since 2022) and the teams winning the toss have opted to bat first 4 out of the 7 matches. The results stand as Bat First - 4 victories, Bat Second - 2 wins, and Draw - 1.</p><p>So shall we expect the team to win the toss and bat first?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Murali Karthik and Matthew Hayden:</strong> \"It is a very good wicket to bat on historically. It has small boundaries and the outfield is lightning fast. This wicket looks similar to the ones we saw in the first two Test matches. We are going to see lots of spin as it is dry. Bat first if you win the toss.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit wins the toss for the first time in the series and elects to bat first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper: </strong></span>\"We will bat first. It is a pretty good dressing room and morale is high. The guys are confident about their skills which is a good thing moving forward. We have played a lot of cricket here but this one is slightly different. Looks a little dry and you have to adapt your skills and be at it all the time. We have to try and repeat the things we did in the first two Tests.<strong> A couple of changes as Gill replaces KL and Umesh gets a chance in place of Shami.</strong>\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Steve Smith, Australian Skipper:</strong></span> \"The surface looks pretty dry, and no surprises to bat first. Hopefully, we can execute our skills early and put the Indian batters under pressure. The guys have had time to rest and get back into preparation and it was most needed. Just stick to our methods for longer periods, we went away from it, especially in the second innings of the last game. <strong>We have two changes Starc comes in for Cummins and Cameron Green comes in for Warner.</strong>\"</p>",

India for the first time here, won the toss and elected to bat first. The ball was turning well and the spinners were into play straight away. Apart from Kohli, no one scored more than 22 runs in the first innings and India was all out for 109. The spinners took all the wickets with M Kuhnemann grabbing a five-wicket haul. In the second innings, Australia scored 197 runs with U Khawaja scoring 60 with M Labuschagne getting 31. R Jadeja was the highest wicket-taker in the innings with four wickets. India trailed by 84 runs and Pujara's 59 helped the team to get a lead of 75 runs. Lyon recorded one of his best figures of 8/64. With 76 runs to chase, Travis Head (49* off 53) and M Labuschagne (28* off 58) took the team over the line. The next Test is scheduled at Ahmedabad on Mar 9th. Will Australia win and level the series or will the Indians get the better of the opposition on a crucial decider?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: </strong></span>\"When you lose a Test match there are a lot of things which didn't go our way. We didn't bat really well in the first innings and we understand how important it is to put runs on the board. Once they got an 80-90 run lead, we had to produce another innings with the bat and we were not able to do that. If we had batted well in the first innings then things would have been different. We need to understand we have to come out and do the job, no matter what the pitches are.&nbsp;One odd game can happen like that and this game was all about that. We want a few guys to stand up and put their hands up to take the team through.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Steve Smith, Australian Captain: </strong></span>\"I think that first day, losing the toss and having to bowl first helped us get this result. Our bowlers did really well, especially Kuhnemann. With the bat, Khawaja was really good in the first innings. We had some good partnerships. India bowled really well in the second innings. Pujji played a good knock, but all our bowlers did really well. It was a complete performance in the end. I like captaining in this part of the world. It's good to be in the WTC final but it's just about playing good cricket.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Nathan Lyon is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Nathan Lyon: </strong></span>\"It has been a remarkable Test series. It is special to perform here. I don't have all the skills but I have the stock ball and try to do it well over and over again. I have been lucky enough to challenge the very best players in the game someone like Virat and Pujara.\"</p>",

The action shifts to the majestic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, with India needing a win to seal a place in the World Test Championship Final.

The Prime Ministers of both nations are also in attendance for the first day.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>VENUE REPORT:-</strong></p><p>India had won the two Tests played at the venue in 2021 against England, with the spinners picking up 48 wickets. Will we see spin dominating again in this test?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Teams have preferred batting 1st at Ahmedabad with both the tests in 2021 seeing the teams choosing to bat first, and the same trend seems to continue in the Ranji Trophy this season as well with teams choosing to bat first in 4/5 matches.</p><p><strong>Pitch Report, Matthew Hayden:</strong> \"The pitch looks different to the one used against England. It looks well rolled, there is an even covering of grass and there are a few dry patches on the surface. Looks slightly damp as well in the morning.

Aussies managed to score 480 with the help of tons from Usman Khawaja and Cameron Green while R. Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers accounting for 6 wickets.On the other side India&#39;s response was led by King Kohli who amassed 186 and Shubman Gill who made 128. A solid reply of 571 from India meant that the Aussies had the task of surpassing the lead of 91 before setting a target for the home team. Australia in the end managed to bat the entire fifth day scoring 175 and losing just two wickets. Aussies fought bravely but fell short to breach the fortress and win the series against India in India. Team India win the series 2-1 and also Keep the Border Gavaskar Trophy home. The two teams are the best in the World and will compete once again in June for the World Test Championship at the Oval.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli:</strong></span> &quot;To be honest, the expectations I have from myself as a player matters more to me. I felt I was batting well from the first innings at Nagpur and carried the form in the innings that followed. We focussed on batting for longer durations. I did that to an extent but not to the capability that I have done in the past so I Was a little disappointed with that. Relief from the point of view that I could play the way I wanted to play and get a hundred.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Steve Smith, Australia skipper:</strong></span> &quot;Was a flat track at the back end but the boys had a great time throughout. The hospitality has been amazing in India, the crowd has been amazing as always. We started to play better as the series went on. The madness and errors in one hour in Delhi cost us that game and that was a crucial moment in the series too. The wicket here was too flat for us to force a result with the time remaining. The spinners bowled really well in the series. Todd Murphy and&nbsp; Matt Kuhnemann bowled with composure alongside Natham Lyon, pretty happy to see them do well.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja share the Player of the Series Award!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ravi Ashwin:</strong></span> &quot;It has been a great journey alongside Ravindra Jadeja. We go back a long way but we wouldn&#39;t be the same or lethal enough without the other. We need to recognize that fact, at least I have started recognizing that over the last couple of years. He gives me a lot of freedom to be creative with the ball, full credit to him, I thought he bowled beautifully in the Delhi Test and that&#39;s why we are here today in such a position. Jaddu keeps it really simple and that reflects in his performances&quot;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja:</strong></span> &quot; It feels very good bowling with him. He is passing on vital information all the time. What field to have for a batter, how to bowl to a particular batter. About my batting, I missed out on a few occasions this series which I would want to work upon. I will work harder and focus on my batting even more.&quot;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;Was a fantastic series overall. A lot of the players were playing this for the first time in their careers. We do understand the importance of this series and the capabilities of the opposition too. A lot of hard work has gone into this in terms of planning and preparations. At different times we have come up with answers to tough situations. We knew how important it was to start the series on a positive note. The Delhi Test, I am very proud of as we were behind in the game and came back. At Indore, it did not go our way. Lot of guys took up the responsibility and bailed us out when the team needed the most. Test Cricket is hard-fought cricket and isn&#39;t easy at any point. I am quite satisfied with how the team has done. I know what kind of benchmark I have set for myself. I keep the personal milestones aside, We have got the result of what I wanted from the series. To get the result makes us very happy.&quot;</p>\n",

The Men in the Blue head into the series on the back of the Test series victory and also qualifying for the WTC Final. It is a good opportunity for the Indian Unit to test its best combination before the upcoming ODI World Cup. Hardik Pandya will lead the side in absence of Rohit Sharma who will join in later in the series. India is currently the best team in the format while Australians are placed second in the ICC Men&#39;s ODI ranking. Steve Smith and co. will look to get some good practice in India which is also the host of the ODI World Cup. The Border Gavaskar Trophy was convincingly won by India, will Australia be able to get past the home team in the ODI format or the Men in Blue will have the upper hand once again? All in all, It will be an exciting contest between two star-studded sides at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong><br />\nIndia and Australia have clashed 143 times out of which Australians have clinched 80 games while India came out victorious on 43 occasions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nMurali Karthik and Ajit Agarkar: &quot;I&#39;m standing at the center pitch from where it is 64 meters to my right and 62 meters to my left. There is a nice even covering of grass, very firm, and will play well for the entire game. There should be some bounce and spinners may not be in the game. Wankhede is always a good chasing ground, especially with the boundary dimensions&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\nHardik Pandya wins the toss and elects to field first!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;We&#39;ll field first. It looks like a good track and the dew will be a factor here. We feel we can do well while chasing. &nbsp;Playing for India every game and every format is important for every player. Especially this being a World cup year, the ODI format is even more important. We&#39;ve gone with four pacers - Shardul Thakur, Mohammad Shami, myself, and Mohammad Siraj. Two spinners in the side are Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Steve Smith, Australian Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;No worries, Good toss to lose actually.

India in response lost four wickets for just 39 on board after which Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul put up a 44-run stand off just 55 balls to get India back in the game.

Rahul was the top scorer with 75* while the left-handed Jadeja finished unbeaten on 45.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the 2nd ODI between two of the biggest cricketing nations, India and Australia at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, Visakhapatnam. India came out victorious in a low scoring encounter at Mumbai, where KL Rahul and Jadeja batted with utmost composure to take India home with an unbeaten century partnership. With Rohit Sharma coming back into the mix, India would be hoping to seal the series. Ishan Kishan is expected to make place for Rohit in this match and also KL Rahul coming back to form is a big plus for India keeping in mind that the world cup is just a few months away. As for Australia, Alex Carey who was out of the mix in the 1st ODI due to illness is expected to return for this encounter. About David Warner, we will have to wait and watch for if he has recovered from the concussion and if he will be available for selection. Let&#39;s head into this cracker of a contest and see what&#39;s waiting ahead for us.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">HEAD TO HEAD :-</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India</span> and <span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Australia</span> have squared off 144 times and Australia has the upper hand with 80 wins and India winning 54 of those. Whereas, <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India</span> have the upper hand in India winning 39 matches and <span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Australia</span> winning 30.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nDeep Das Gupta: &quot;The pitch was under covers just an hour back and there were hints of slight drizzle but look at it now, the covers are off, and it&#39;s bright and sunny. The pitch looks firm and it doesn&#39;t look like that the cracks will open up soon. There will be some moisture as the pitch has been under covers for the last couple days. Batting would get easier as the day progresses. The toss winning captain should prefer bowling first.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>TOSS:-</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Steve Smith</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong> and </strong></span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Australia</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong> win the toss and elect to field first!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Steve Smith, Australian Skipper:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong> &quot;We will bowl first. This is a different wicket and it has been under covers for a while. We learn a lot from playing at these pitches. We have a couple of changes, </strong></span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Nathan Ellis comes in for Maxwell who is a bit sore and Alex Carey comes in for Josh Inglis</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong> &quot;Doesn&#39;t really matter now (Laughs on asking what he would have done if he had won the toss). We have to bat well and let&#39;s see where we end up after the 1st innings. Every game is a pressure game when you play for India. Two changes for us too, </strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ishan misses out and I am back for him. Shardul is also out and Axar replaces him</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>. We would have bowled first if we had won the toss, given that we have 3 spinners and playing 3 spinners is also something we might go into the world cup with.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1-10 Overs) :-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India- 51/5 (5.1 rpo, 6x4, 0x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>|| <span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Australia- 112/0 (11.2 rpo, 15x4, 6x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Middle Overs (11-26 Overs) :-&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India- 66/5 (4.1 rpo, 3x4, 2x6)</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Australian Team after suffering a defeat in the first ODI came back in some fashion getting the Indian team all out for just 117 after asking them to bat first. The opening Spell from Mitchell Starc proved to be lethal as he managed to get four out of the top five wickets with just 48 runs on board. Only Virat Kohli and Axar Patel got decent starts but failed to convert the same into big scores. Mitchell Starc&#39;s fifer was well-complimented by Ellis and Abbott from the other end. In Response, The Australian openers Mitch Marsh and Travis Head came out all guns blazing and finished the run chase in just 11 overs. The series is well poised after this dominating effort from the Australian Unit especially after suffering a heavy loss in the series opener at Wankhede. We will now move on to Chennai for the series decider.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: &quot;It was not a 117 wicket by any means. We did not apply ourselves and play well. We did manage some runs in the middle but again failed to make big partnerships as we kept losing wickets at regular intervals. It was one of those days when nothing goes your way. Taking nothing away from the Aussies, Starc did what he has been doing for the team. Mitchell Marsh is one of the top batters when it comes to power hitting and we saw that in the first ODI too. It is important for us to move on from this and bounce back.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Steve Smith, Australian Captain: &quot;Was a quick one today. Only 37 overs in the entire game. Mitch Starc was brilliant with the new ball which put them under pressure straight away. There was no total in mind for restricting the Indians just that we need to stick to our plans. We were just trying to execute our plans. Just that kind of a day when the edges went to hand and we managed to hold onto them. The way Travis Head and Mitch Marsh played at the start was phenomenal. They just kept going at a good rate and we are able to bounce back after the loss in the last game&quot;.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Mitchell Starc is the Player of the Match.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Mitchell Starc: &quot;I have learned the trade over the years and am now able to do it regularly. My rhythm has been good lately. My length is a little fuller than before and in comparison to other guys in the team. I have been given a definite role in the team and I stick to that. My conversations are a little different compared to someone like Cameron Green or Sean Abbott. The tracks in both games have assisted the seamers, especially with the breeze going around. My role is to attack stumps and get early dismissals and I am happy that I have been able to do that for the side&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the Live commentary of match three of the ODI series between India and Australia. The series decider will take place at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai. The first ODI at Wankheded was dominated by the Indian Team whereas Australia got the better of the hosts at Vizag in the previous game. The final will answer a lot of questions about the two teams in terms of their squad and playing combination for the upcoming ODI World cup which is going to take place in India. The series has so far seen the pace bowlers having a treat in the middle as both the matches ended as low-scoring encounters. One can expect slightly different conditions in spin-friendly conditions in Chennai. Australian seamers seem to have got the rhythm while Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh have been instrumental with the bat for the Aussies. One can expect a change in the batting order if David Warner recovers from his injury sustained during the BGT Series. India on the other side will look to give another opportunity to the eleven that featured in the previous games. It will be a cracker of a contest at an expected full house at the Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong>&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Sanjay Manjrekar and Ajit Agarkar</strong>: &quot;Pitch is slightly off-center, so the dimensions change a little and it&#39;s going to be a long boundary on one side. As we have seen the Bowlers have had a little bit of help throughout the series. This track too has a covering of grass and also has rough in the center. It&#39;s quite hard and the roughness might be a factor in the first innings. It might be slightly two-paced initially in the game. Teams winning the toss will like to bowl first as it gets cooler it turns into a belter to bat.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head to Head:</strong><br />\nTwo teams have clashed 145 times out of which 54 have been won by India while 81 results have gone to the Aussies.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Australia wins the toss and elects to bat first!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Steve Smith, Australian Skipper</strong></span>: &quot;We are gonna have a bat. Looks like a very dry surface and it is pretty hot out here as well. Will look to put some runs on this surface and defend later on. We have had good fun in the series which has been very competitive and it will be exciting in the decider today. We love playing in the crunch games and it&#39;s exciting for us to come &nbsp;out and put upna show. Ashton Agar and David Warner comes in to the side. Cameron Green sits out due to bad health.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper</strong></span>: &quot;We were looking to field first. If at all there will be help for the bowlers and we are playing three spinners today like last game, in these dry conditions hopefully we can maximize our spin options. It&#39;s an important game and finals are always exciting. It&#39;s always good to be in such situations. It&#39;s a challenge for us to come back after what happened in the last game and play some good cricket under pressure when it matters the most. Hopefully, we can put our best foot forward and win the series&quot;</p>\n",

Head and Marsh were once again successful to get Australia off to a good start but the middle order once again failed to have a major impact. Aussies managed to put up 269 runs on the board with Marsh being the top scorer with 47 against his name. Hardik Pandya was the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets to his credit while Jadeja bowled economically conceding just 34 from his 10 overs. In reply, India got a good start courtesy of Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill who added 65 for the first wicket. Kohli and KL Rahul too got a good partnership between them but could not capitalize on it. India kept losing wickets and the Aussies managed to put breaks on the scoring rate which ultimately resulted in India falling short by 21 runs. Adam Zampa picked four scalps and was impressed with the way he operated. Australia fought well and came out victorious against India on Indian soil which deserves a round of applause. All in all, it was a hard-fought series between the top two sides in World Cricket at the moment.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</span> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;I don&#39;t think it was too many runs on the board. We didn&#39;t bat well, to be honest. Partnerships are crucial while chasing and that is something we failed to do in this game. We know the wickets well and it&#39;s important you apply yourself while you&#39;re in the middle. After the start, it was important for one batter to carry on and take the game deep. It just didn&#39;t happen today. We can take a lot of positives from the nine ODIs since January. We need to understand where we need to improve and execute accordingly.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Steve Smith, Australian Skipper: &quot;It&#39;s been an enjoyable tour overall. I would say We didn&#39;t play our best cricket, good enough to get over the line though. This wicket was entirely different today, we left a few out there with the bat and could have got more. But the spinners bowled beautifully, with really good performances from Zampa and Agar. It was a grind to get the India batters out from the moment when they were cruising along. Happy with the way things have gone.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Adam Zampa is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Adam Zampa: &quot;Yes, I have had some success here. It&#39;s a tough place to come and deliver, always a huge challenge when you&#39;re playing in India against India. I try to stay in the game and be competitive always. Ashton Agar changed the game today and helped me with my spell too. Kudos to the bowlers who bowled before me as they set the tone really well for me.&nbsp;&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Mitchelle Marsh is the player of series</strong></span><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Mitchelle Marsh: &quot;There is this Natural aggression when it comes to batting. It&#39;s been a lot of fun while opening the innings. We have Warner who&#39;ll come back at some stage and open the innings. About me, I&#39;m coming off an extended break and have worked on a lot of things. Came here really fresh for the series and glad that I could deliver.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n",

Will India make the qualification worth it unlike the last time or will the Australians dominate here in England? Can the Indians create history? How will the playing combination be for India?

Both the teams worked really hard and showed great agility for a long time and that is the reason for both the teams to get into the biggest stage of the longest format. However, Australia were better in this given Test and bagged the match by 209 runs. The toss favored the Indians and they chose to bowl first considering the conditions. The centuries from Steve Smith and Travis Head set the tone for a huge total and the team registered 469 runs. M Siraj was the highest wicket-taker for India with 4 scalps. After picking a few early wickets in the 1st Indian innings, the partnership of 109-run between Ajinkya Rahane and Shardul Thakur helped the team avoid the follow-on! With a lead of 173 runs on day 3, Australia were to set an unachievable target for India. Alex Carey&#39;s 66 runs were the highest from their batting and they declared after setting 444 runs. With a huge target to chase which would have been turned as the World record, the Indian batters Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill started off with positive intentions but unfortunately, Gill was turned out. Hope was there until Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane battled through but wickets fell in regular intervals and were all out for 234 runs with Nathan Lyon taking 4 and Boland taking 3 crucial wickets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Travis Head is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Travis Head:</strong></span> &quot;We put in a lot of hard work over the two years.

I&#39;ve always had the confidence and It&#39;s about going out there and expressing that. I&#39;ve always been open to learning. I&#39;ve bedded down somewhat of a blueprint. It&#39;s not always going to work. It&#39;s nice to work that out in such a big game and hopefully continues in the next couple of months.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;I thought we started well putting them to bat in those conditions. We bowled well in the first session and then we let ourselves down. Got to give credit to the Australian batters. Head came in and played really well along with Smith. That just took us off guard a little bit. We knew it was always hard to come back, but we put up a good show. We fought till the end. We&#39;ve worked hard for all those four years. Playing two finals is honestly a good achievement for us. But we&#39;d like to go a mile ahead as well. Unfortunate that we couldn&#39;t go on and win the final but we&#39;ll keep our heads high and fight. The cheer from the crowd has been brilliant.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins, Australian Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;We made the most of it after losing the toss. We also wanted to bowl. The way Head and Smith put on that partnership, gave us the comfort. Head has been brilliant right throughout this campaign. We left day one feeling like we were on top of the game. When it counted, we played really well. We could have really driven the game, didn&#39;t have our best day, and let India closer back in. For the most part, we were in control. Everyone played really well and we&#39;ll savour this for a few years. This is our favourite format, we grew up watching Test cricket. It challenges you. When you win, it&#39;s the format you get most satisfaction with.&quot;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and a warm welcome to the audience of Test cricket as the Indian team is all set to face the WIndies after a small break since the World Test Championship last month. India are here at Dominica after 2011 and Virat Kohli was the only player who played last here in the current squad. West Indies previously played their Test against South Africa in March. We might get to see some new faces here for this Test as <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Y Jaiswal and I Kishan have been handed over the cap!</strong></span> Can they perform well on their debut?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p>\n\n<p>India and West Indies have squared off against each other 98 times in Test cricket and India has 22 games to their tally while the hosts West Indies lead the number with 30 wins. 46 matches have ended in a draw. However, India have won 4 out of their last 5 clashes.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong><br />\nA total of 5 Test matches have been played here since 2011 and the teams have opted to bowl first three times but the result have favoured the teams batting first thrice. The average innings scores here are&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>1st Innings - 246<br />\n2nd Innings - 302<br />\n3rd Innings - 222</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>West Indies won the toss and elected to bat first!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Kraigg Brathwaite, West Indies Skipper: &quot;We will bat first. The surface is dry, we&#39;ll have to work hard in the first hour. We had a practice game amongst ourselves and was looking good. We have been in good positions during the last cycle, but it&#39;s all about being consistent. Want to see the guys be positive. Athanaze makes his debut. Cornwall and Warrican are the two spinners with Alzarri and Roach being the pacers.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper: &quot;We played a practice game in Barbados and we are here in Dominica for the last 4 days. Rain played a spoilsport but we are well prepared. The championship cycle final is two years away, but we&#39;ve been consistent over the previous cycles. New guys in the squad, we just want to keep better as a team. I want the two debutants to enjoy, they&#39;ve worked hard to come here, I want to make them feel comfortable and have some good memories of their first Test.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

West Indies had the advantage with the toss and they chose to bat first at this wicket. Ravi Ashwin opened the account early in the innings and ended up picking 5 wickets. Apart from the local boy Alick Athanaze&#39;s 47, the WI batting collapsed for 150 runs. The Indian openers Jaiswal and Rohit partnered for 229 runs with each of them scoring centuries. Jaiswal later went on to convert his ton into 150 and got out for 171 runs. V Kohli at number four did his part by making 76 runs.&nbsp;<br />\nWith a lead of 271 runs, India declared the innings. R Ashwin once again proved why he is the No.1 Test bowler by taking a 7-wicket haul making his best overseas record with 11 wickets.&nbsp; The WI team were all out for 130 runs and India sealed the match by 141 runs and innings!</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Yashasvi Jaiswal is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Yashasvi Jaiswal: &quot; We prepared pretty well. Spoke a lot to Rahul Dravid sir and learned from him. Would like to thank all the selectors and Rohit sir for having faith in me. It&#39;s really nice, I have been working on this. Playing Test cricket for India is very special and emotional. This is just the start, I need to keep my focus and keep working on my cricket. Lots of people helped me through my journey and I want to thank each and every one of them.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Kraigg Brathwaite, West Indies Captian: &quot;I want to thank the crowd for coming. The pitch was playing well on day one, we let ourselves down with the bat. It wasn&#39;t spinning a lot. It is my job to lead from the front but I couldn&#39;t get runs. We lost too many wickets in the first innings. You need to have the right balance between defending and trying to score. We didn&#39;t execute the shots we wanted to, and we need to learn to use the bat more. Athinaze had a very good start, the way he batted. He will do a lot for West Indies cricket.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: &quot;I would like to start by saying it was a great effort with the ball. Getting them out for 150 set the game for us. We knew batting would get tough, it wasn&#39;t easy to score runs. We knew we wanted to bat only once and bat long. Jaiswal has the talent, he has shown us in the past that he is ready. Both Ashwin and Jadeja were splendid, especially Ashwin for coming out and bowling this way was class. Always nice to start well, it is a fresh cycle. We weren&#39;t too worried about the pitch, we wanted to come here and get results. Important to start well, now about taking that momentum into the 2nd Test. There are a couple of new guys and people who haven&#39;t had much Test cricket, so just about getting them out on the field now.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the second and final Test between West Indies and India at Queen&#39;s Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad. India stamped the authority by winning the previous fixture by an innings and 141 runs. Y Jaiswal served a classy 171-run feast on his debut in the previous match and Ashwin was the star with the ball with 12 scalps. West Indies has named the Off-spinner K Sinclar for this Test and will he get his Test cap here while India may go with their same strong XI. Can India seal the series or will West Indies fight back today to nullify the series?</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is the 100th TEST between these two teams! Also, a special match for the Indian run-machine Virat Kohli as he is all set to play his 500th International game!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong><br />\nA total of 4 Test matches have been played here since 2012 and the teams have opted to bat first on all occasions. Once the teams batting first have won and once the team bowling first has won. The other two matches have ended in a draw.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Average Scores by innings:</strong><br />\n1st innings - 315<br />\n2nd innings - 301<br />\n3rd innings - 238</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS:-<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies opts to field first!</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Kraigg Brathwaite, West Indies Captain: &quot;We&nbsp;will bowl first. Shannon Gabriel is back on the team. McKenzie makes his debut today.&nbsp;There&#39;s some moisture on the pitch.&nbsp;We got to be mentally ready for the challenge as the first game is gone. We got to believe in ourselves. We came a long way, in the matches between India and West Indies. Recently we haven&#39;t won, looking to change it.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &quot;We wanted to bat first. Looks nice and sunny as well. It&#39;s going to get slower. Unfortunately, Shardul has pulled up a niggle and he&#39;s not fit. Mukesh Kumar has worked well in domestic and is going to make his debut. There are a lot of memories, the rivalry between the two teams has always been exciting to watch. We work hard and hopefully, we get the result we are expected of.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Day 1:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India - 288/4 (84 overs, 3.4 rpo, 32x4, 3x6)</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 2:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India - 150/6 (44 overs, 3.4 rpo, 16x4, 0x6)</span>&nbsp;||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies - 86/1 (41 overs, 2.1 rpo, 8x4, 1x6)&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies - 143/4 (67 overs, 2.1 rpo, 11x4, 1x6)&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 4:<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&nbsp;West Indies - 26/5 (7.4 overs, 3.4 rpo, 3x4, 0x6)&nbsp;</span>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India - 181/2 (24 overs, 7.5 rpo, 14x4, 6x6)&nbsp;</span>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies - 76/2 (32 overs, 2.4 rpo, 10x4, 0x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rain played spoilsport on the 5th day and the match ends in a draw! The first match of the two-match series was won by India and hence the Indian team is the winner of the Test series.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nWest Indies won the toss and opted to field first. The opening partnership of 139 runs between Rohit (57 off 74) &amp; Jaiswal (80 off 43) set the platform for a big total after which Virat Kohli pulled off his 76th International century with Jadeja who scored 61 runs. Ashwin in the end put up 56 runs to make the total 438. Apart from the West Indies Skipper who scored 75 runs, there was not much contribution from the other batters which led the team to score 255. Siraj accounted for 5 wickets in that innings. With a lead of 181 runs, the Indian batters fired quickly to score 181 runs in just 24 overs which then took the Indian lead to 364 runs. With this target, the West Indian batters lost two wickets on the final session of the fourth day. With 289 runs to win on the final day, the rain played the spoilsport and hence we end the match in a draw.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammed Siraj is the Player of the Match<br />\nMohammed Siraj:</strong></span> &quot;This is my first Player of the Match award in Tests, so I am very happy. There wasn&#39;t much help for the Pacers, so performing here feels good. I kept my plans simple and executed. When you pick wickets in conditions like this, you get great confidence. The captain asked me to believe in myself and enjoy.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Kraigg Brathwaite, West Indies captain:</strong></span> &quot;We showed some fight in this game with the bat. We can be more disciplined with the ball. It was a good comeback from the batters. We lost five wickets yesterday, that wasn&#39;t good. We had 98 overs on a pitch that was relatively good and we were positive. Unfortunately with the weather, we didn&#39;t get a chance. Alick looked good. Kirk looked good in his first match. These two guys showed promise. I have a lot of belief in these two. Preparation is important. We need to bat for long periods against good teams.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India captain:</strong></span> &quot;Every win is different. Playing here has its own challenge. We gave it a good shot, unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t get any play today. We were quite confident. We always wanted that kind of score where we wanted to challenge the opposition. There wasn&#39;t much on the surface. Siraj, I have been watching closely. He&#39;s taken such a giant step. He has led this attack. I don&#39;t want anyone to lead the attack. You want the entire pace attack to take responsibility. You need guys like Ishan. We wanted quick runs, we promoted him, he wasn&#39;t afraid. In Test matches, you need guys who stabilize the innings like Virat did, he played superbly. You need a mixture of everything. We have depth, and we have got variety. We are in the right place.&quot;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome back to the limited format cricket of the Indian team as they are all set to face the West Indies at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados. After winning the Test series 1-0, we are here for the first of the three ODIs. With the World Cup coming up in a few months, all the ODIs played will be used to assess the positives and negatives of the teams and can be used to set the ideal XI. Whereas the West Indies team will not be participating in this World Cup. India played their last ODI series in March against Australia where they suffered a 2-1 loss. Who will start the series with a win today?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p>\n\n<p>Both the teams have clashed against each other 139 times with India leading the tally with 70 wins and WI with 63 wins!</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong><br />\nA total of 45 ODIs have been played at this venue in which the teams batting first has won 19 times and the teams batting second have won 25 times.&nbsp;<br />\nAverage Scores by Innings:<br />\n1st innings - 230<br />\n2nd innings - 200</p>\n\n<p>Can we expect the teams to win the toss and elect to bowl first?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Samuel Badree and Shakera Selman:</strong>&nbsp;&quot;The game will be played on pitch three. The square boundaries are around 65 meters and the straight boundaries are around 70 meters. It is generally a dry surface and the pitch might have a bit of a spongy bounce.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India wins the toss and elects to field first!</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper: &quot;We will bowl first. No particular reason, we want to try a few different things. We want to get into the World Cup with a clear mindset. We are going to try out different players. The results are also important. We have got four seamers and two spinners. Mukesh makes his debut.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shai Hope, West Indies Skipper: &quot;Every series is important for us. We&#39;ve got to play to win. Now is a good opportunity to do so against a top team. We have got some good spinners as well. We will try to put up a good score on the surface. There will be a bit of moisture and we need to be bat careful in the beginning to score big.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>Excellent start here for India as they show their supreme domination with the ball! On winning the toss, India elected to bowl first. The Indian pacers opened the wicket tally after which the spinners Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav accounted for 3 and 4 wickets respectively. The West Indies skipper Shai Hope was the highest scorer of the innings with 43 runs. They were all out for 114 runs. With a considerably low target to chase, the Indian batting order was tested as Ishan Kishan opened with Gill on the other end. Ishan successfully scored his fourth fifty but few wickets were taken by the WI bowlers to impose pressure. However, the target was chasable easily and it was done with 5 wickets remaining. With this win, India go 1-0 in the series!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Kuldeep Yadav is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Kuldeep Yadav: &quot;The fast bowlers bowled really well with Mukesh making his debut well. Jaddu and I were brilliant, we hit the right lengths which was necessary on this wicket. I&#39;m just focusing on my rhythm, hitting the right lengths and it has been very nice. I thought it will be a seamy paradise, we are happy to get wickets from our side. It was spinning a bit, and there was a bounce as well. It&#39;s always good to have competition. We enjoy each other&#39;s company.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shai Hope, West Indies captain: &quot;We didn&#39;t play the way we needed to. We need to find ways to score on difficult pitches like this. I&#39;m not making excuses. Seales is a quality bowler, we can invest on him and I hope he grows from strength to strength. The Indian bowlers did well on this surface, but we didn&#39;t bat well.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: &quot;I never thought the pitch would play like that. The pitch had everything for seamers and spinners, our guys did well to restrict them to that score. We wanted to give game time to the guys who have come in. We knew we could try these guys and give them a go. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll get many chances like this. Mukesh was brilliant, he can swing the ball at a good pace. Good to see what he can offer. No matter the conditions, we need to bowl in the right areas to restrict them and I thought our bowlers did brilliantly. And then Ishan was good with the bat as well.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and Welcome to the live Commentary of the second match of the ODI series against the West Indies at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados. West Indies suffered a big loss in their first match as they got all out for 114 runs which was then chased by India in 23 overs. Will we see any changes in their XI? Will the pitch be the same way as the first ODI? Can India seal the series today? A lot to answer here today!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Daren Ganga and Shakera Selman:</strong> &quot;This is the same pitch as the last game. The wicket is usually hard but there is a hard length area and the bowlers can extract some turn and bounce. There will be variable bounce and a high amount of turn that was there in the first match and things can be challenging.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>West Indies won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shai Hope, West Indies Captain: &quot;We opt to bowl firs. We knew what happened here in the last game. The conditions will assist the bowlers. We got to win this one to stay alive in the series. Have to play on the same surface. We got to bowl first and put them under pressure. Powell and Drakes are out. Alzarri Joseph and Keacy Carty replaces them.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Captain: &quot;We wanted to bat first. We want to see how much we can score on this pitch which is a bit up and down. Rohit and Virat have been playing constant cricket, so they are resting in this game. I think when you get someone out for 115, it&#39;s a good effort from the bowlers. Our catching was impressive, but we can improve in certain areas. Instead of losing five wickets, we could have lost only two. Sanju Samson and Axar Patel comes in for Rohit and Virat.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The hosts won the toss this time and opted to field first. The opening partnership between I Kishan (55 off 55) and S Gill was worth 90 runs until the 17th over when Gill was dismissed for 34 runs. The West Indian bowlers never left the momentum fall and were accounted for wickets often. Both G Motie and R Shepherd scalped 3 wickets each putting the Indian team&#39;s batting to an end for 181 runs. In the second innings, Shardul Thakur went for a couple of wickets in the same over but the stand between the skipper S Hope (63* off 80) and K Carty (48* off 65) steadied the ship and neared the target. They both stayed till the end and finished the job for their team. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The series stands 1-1 now and the third and final ODI will be an exciting decider.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Captain: &quot;We did not bat the way we wanted to. The wicket got much better than in the first innings. Disappointing, but got to learn many more things. The way the openers batted was brilliant. Shardul kept our hopes alive. Hope batted very well, they held their nerves and got over the line. I have to bowl more overs to get ready for the World Cup. The next game will be exciting for the viewers as well as the players.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shai Hope is the Player of the Match</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shai Hope, West Indies Skipper: &quot;I am happy to have contributed and when the team wins. You got to find ways to score quickly on that wicket, especially against a quality bowling attack like India. Got to win the next game to take the series. The guys are going to come hard again. We need to be more consistent with the bat and ball. The surface was challenging, but the bowlers and batters did well. We want to be the winning side and if we tick all the boxes, I am pretty sure we can achieve that.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The winner of today&#39;s match will bag this series. The stalwarts Rohit and Virat may be back for today&#39;s game, so who do you think will make way for them?

India were put into bat by West indies after they won the toss. Initially, The Indian openers got of to a positive start by putting a 143-run stand. Ishan Kishan and Shubman Gill scored (77 &amp; 85)runs respectively. After losing Ishan and Gill in quick successions, Hardik Pandya and Sanju Samson&#39;s innings of (70 &amp; 51) runs respectively helped to continue the momentum. This Helped India to score a mammoth total of 351 in 50 overs. West Indian Openers could not tackle the Indian pace attack and lost the wickets in continuos intervals. The way Mukesh Kumar bowled in the initial overs was outstanding by taking 3 quick wickets. Then it was a collapse for the host&#39;s middle order. Kuldeep and Unadkat doing the damage. The West Indies had a good 8th wicket partnership of 55 Runs from Motie and Joseph. Shardul Thakur picked up 4 wickets with his top quality bowling. It was a valiant effort from the Indian team which help them win this contest by a huge margin. &nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill: &quot;Very special on my first half-century on this tour. I was hoping to get a big score for my team maybe a century but that did not happen the match was on our hands. It was a good track to bat on but things changed when the ball got older. It is all about playing by the situation and pre-meditating it as soon as possible. As an opener, it&#39;s your duty to do give a &nbsp;headstart to the team and luckily I was able to do the same. I thought in the last match I was settled I was trying for a big score and trying to put pressure on the opponent. That&#39;s the way this format works as well. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think who is playing and who is not. I always try to do my best.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ishan Kishan is the Player of the Series</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ishan Kishan: &quot;Not so happy with the finishing that I gave. I should have scored big after getting a good start. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll try next time. I was thinking of taking it one ball at a time. Shubman Gill is a tremendous player. Seeing him hitting it out of the middle gives me a lot of confidence. The learnings from these games are important. We were looking to get early wickets. Everyone is looking very positive. I&rsquo;ve played a few tournaments here and I know how the wickets play here.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shai Hope, West Indies skipper: &quot;We restricted them well enough seeing how the pitch behaved before. We can look back and change many things but we have to accept it. We didn&#39;t give them a challenge with the ball at the start. 350 was a gettable total on that wicket. We gotta believe that we can win. The consistency in attitude and the key is to get the guys together and turn some of these losses into wins.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Skipper: &quot;As a captain, I look forward to these types of games where something is at stake and not just an international match. The way the boys came out and expressed their character and at the same time enjoyed, that&#39;s the thing I want this team to possess. In these kinds of pressure situations, they have to be used to it but also enjoy it. Kohli and Rohit are very important part of this team. So providing youngsters the kind of exposure and making sure that if we need to check something, we can do that. The pitch was doing well. I was just waiting my time and once I got the flow I could get the rest. The ball was doing a bit initially. When you are chasing a total of 350, batters will feel the difficulty. A couple of good catches by Gill as well. &nbsp;West Indies woke up late with that partnership and took the game till the 34th over but the game was over in the powerplay phase itself. This is one of the nicest stadiums that I have played on.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and Welcome to the Live Commentary of the first of the five-match T20 series between India and West Indies. The match is set to take place at the &nbsp;Brian Lara Stadium, Tarouba, Trinidad which has hosted just one T20I before today&#39;s encounter. Men in Blue would be high on confidence after a good outing in the Test and ODI series and would look to continue their form in the T20 format as well. Hardik Pandya will lead the side in this match which also happens to be Team India&#39;s 200th T20I. Team India played its first T20I match back in 2006 against South Africa. A young and fresh-looking Indian Unit under the leadership of Hardik Pandya would be looking to leave a mark against a side that usually enjoys playing the shorter format. The Two times World Champions would be hoping for a change in their fortunes against a side that lacks experience but is no short of talent. Team India would be without the services of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in their 4th straight T20 series which means that the young guns would be having loads of chances to express themselves out in the middle at the highest level.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong><br />\nThere has been only one T20I played at Brian Lara Stadium which was also between India and West Indies. Team India posted 190 while the hosts managed to score just 122.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\nTwo teams have clashed 25 times out of which 17 have been won by India while 7 results have gone to the Windies.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong><br />\nDenesh Ramdin: &quot;Looks like a good pitch, 350 runs were scored in the ODI played here. The Wicket is not expected to change much in the course of the game. The team winning the toss would fancy batting first to have some runs on the board.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\nWest-Indies wins the toss and elect to bat first!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Rovman Powell, West-Indian Skipper:</span> &quot; <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">We will have a bat. Looks like a dry wicket. India is playing a lot of spinners, let&#39;s see how we cope against them. The boys are confident. It&#39;s not a complete change in strategy. We are still boundary hitters and we will try to run hard.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya, Indian Skipper: &quot; Since we play the T20 World Cup here, we have made plans accordingly. Some players might get a chance to play here. By the time we come here next time, we&#39;ll be prepared thoroughly . I try to keep things simple. For me, it&#39;s about improving. I focus on processes. You might have some losses and failures, but I am okay with it. It&#39;s all about challenging ourselves. Umran, Bishnoi miss out. We are playing three spinners.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Defending 150 was never going to be easy, especially against a formidable Indian batting unit. Akeal Hosein bowled a tight spell in the powerplay but a partnership of 39 (27) between Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma kept India in the hunt. Another steady partnership between Skipper Hardik Pandya and Sanju Samson had India in the driver&#39;s seat until the 16th over bowled by Jason Holder which saw the back of both the set batters. A maiden over accounting for two wickets proved to be the turning point in the match. India fell short by 4 runs in the end.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rovman Powell, West Indian Skipper: &quot; It&#39;s a very good feeling to start on a positive note. They didn&#39;t have a set batter and I was confident going in the final over. After watching the Indians bowl, I thought we were one spinner short. It was difficult against spinners. We knew the new ball was going to give runs. This series will be decided on how West Indies batters bat against Indian spinners. Once you get a start, it&#39;s easier. Jason Holder was fantastic today.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jason Holder is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jason Holder: &quot;The amount of cricket I&#39;ve been playing is quite a lot. Much needed break from the ODIs. I was happy just I stuck with my plans. I wanted to make them work hard for their runs and didn&#39;t want to give any easy runs. The 16th over was the turning point as the game was getting close. The guys stuck together and total team effort saw us through.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Skipper: &quot; We were right to chase. We made some errors that cost us the game. A young team will make mistakes. We will learn. Good four games ahead. In T20 cricket, if you lose wickets, it becomes difficult to chase. A couple of hits can change the momentum. When we lost a couple of wickets, that halted us.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The match takes place at the National Stadium, Guyana. After a comfortable victory from the hosts in the first T20I, the visitors are keen to clinch the second T20I and keep the series in balance. What will be the plans of the young Indian lineup for this encounter?

There is a bit of light grass on the wicket which may assist the pacers early on. It is also quite hard. Any score above 150 is a good one. Slower balls will be vital in the second innings.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>TOSS:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>INDIA WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO BAT&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;FIRST.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Skipper: &quot;We choose to bat first as the surface looks good. We will try to put a good score on the board. We did lose a couple of wickets during crunch moments. I don&#39;t think we did much wrong in the last game other than that, we spoke about it and the focus is to learn and keep going ahead. Kuldeep got injured on the hand yesterday in the nets so Ravi Bishnoi comes in place of him.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rovman Powell, West Indies Skipper: &quot;The wicket looks a pretty good surface and hopefully gets better as the game progresses. We did not lose wickets in clusters in the previous game which was good. it is about continuing to do the right things for the team and keep improving as a batting unit.

With India opting to bat first, the team lost two crucial wickets of Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav in the powerplay but the partnership of Ishan Kishan and Tilak Varma steadied the innings. Tilak scored his maiden T20I half-century. Hardik hit two sixes and India managed to put 152 Runs on the board. In the second innings, Hardik picked 2 wickets in the very first over putting pressure on the opposition! Pooran and Powell put up a vital partnership for 57 runs. Hetmyer played according to the situation as the run rate required was achievable. Indian spinners came back and shifted the momentum in their favor, but Akeal Hosein and Alzarri Joseph finished things and helped Windies go 2-0 in this Five match series.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nicholas Pooran is the Player of the Match.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nicholas Pooran: &quot;I am very Satisfied that I performed well. Something that I have been looking for the last couple of years, so be there and finish the game. I look to be consistent. I have been working on it so hard, I have made a lot of mistakes and lost a lot of games for the teams I have played. It&#39;s about being positive and confident at the same time.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya, Indian Captain: &quot;That was a not a pleasing batting performance, we could have batted better. 170 would have been a decent total. The way Pooran batted, took the game quite into their hands. We have to trust our top seven batters to come good and hope the bowlers win you games. We have to make sure we have the right balance but at the same time, batters need to take more responsibility. Tilak batted well and a Left-hander coming at 4 gives us variety. It doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s his second international game.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rovman Powell, West Indies Captain: &quot;It is a very good position to be in. Since 2016 we have not won the T20 series. It was important to change the bowlers constantly and give an over spell, especially fast bowlers because it is very hot conditions here. When you are batting against wrist spin it is difficult. To restrict Chahal, Kuldeep, and Bishnoi we need to have left-handers. To have Pooran and Hetmyer is important to counter the attack.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The first two matches were won by the hosts putting the visitors in a challenge today. To stay alive in the series, India needs to register a win today here. With India losing two of their games, will we have any changes in the side to change the fortune?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Daren Ganga:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s a little bit cloudy today. It&#39;s the same pitch. 66m on one square, 67m on the other, and 77m down the ground. The pitch looks good but it&#39;s a bit drier and hard than the previous game.

Holder picked up a niggle to his knee so Roston Chase comes in. Guys are excited, we are on the doorstep of history by beating India in a T20 series.

If you become predictable, they will destroy you.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India Skipper: &quot;We don&#39;t mind chasing but we wanted to bat first seeing the surface.

After the Indian spinners started taking wickets especially Kuldeep Yadav picking 3 wickets. The middle order from hosts namely Pooran and Powell played a good knock (20 &amp; 40) respectively. The West Indies went on to score 159 Runs in 20 overs with the loss of 5 wickets. West Indies had a positive start by taking Jaiswal out in the first over but Surya started retaliating against the West Indian bowlers from the first ball. Surya and Tilak had an amazing partnership of 87 from just 51 deliveries where Surya scored 83 off just 44 balls which helped India to gain an advantage to win the match. Hardik Pandya joined with Tilak Varma (49 Runs) to put on a winning partnership and the skipper finished the match with an amazing sixer.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav is the Player of the Match</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav: &quot;It was really important to be myself when I went in to bat. The team management also wanted me to do the same. I have practised these strokes a lot and I love doing that. Me and Tilak understand how each other bats and the way he batted it gave me a lot of confidence. It was a superb innings from him. Our captain said someone needs to put their hand up and win the match, glad I was able to do that.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Indian Skipper: &quot;Very important to win this game. We spoke as a team that all these three matches will be important. Two losses or wins will not change the long-term plans. We have to show we are ready when it comes to such must-win games. Pooran didn&#39;t come out to bat and that allowed us to keep our fast bowlers back, also allowed Axar to bowl his quota of four overs. If Pooran wants to hit, let him hit and that was the plan we talked about, I enjoy such kind of competition. As a team, we have decided to bat with seven batters and we have to take responsibility. As Surya said, they play together and spend time together, good to have someone like SKY in the team and when he takes responsibility it sends a nice message to the others in the team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rovman Powell, West Indies Captain: &quot;We were short by 10-15 runs. Credit to the batting unit especially the opening partnership, that&#39;s the kind of start we needed. We wanted to give Charles an opportunity, we know what Pooran can do and what kind of form he is in. We bowled with too much pace on the ball and that made it easy for the Indian batters. We have a few days gap and we have to come up with better plans.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

The action shifts to the United States as the series stands at 2-1. Can India continue the momentum and level the series tonight?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>West Indies won the toss and will bat first</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rovman Powell, West Indies Captain:</strong></span> &quot;We will bat first. It looks a very good surface, we want to put up some runs on the board and try to defend it. I think it is an opportunity for us to win a series against a big team like India. Jason Holder is in, Shai Hope comes in for Johnson Charles and Odean Smith comes in for Roston Chase.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India Captain:</strong></span> &quot;We would have also batted first. I think the boys turned up very well, they were excited, and at the same time, they realized that they have to show some more hunger as well. Same team for us. Our spinners have that wicket-taking knack, which I like. For us, we keep things simple, and we don&#39;t let the intensity drop.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT: </strong></p>\n\n<p>Samuel Badree: &quot;It is 65 metres hit to one side, the opposite is 67 metres, and down the ground is 70 metres. There isn&rsquo;t any grass on the surface but it has a nice sheen to it. The average score on this ground is 165. We are in for a high-scoring game.&quot;</p>\n",

After West Indies choosing to bat, Arshdeep Singh struck twice in the Powerplay to remove both the openers after which Kuldeep Yadav removed both of Nicholas Pooran and Rovamn Powell in a single over putting pressure on the Windies. Shimron Hetmyer struck from one end with a half-century but some brilliant death bowling from Mukesh Kumar ensured that West Indies finished their innings on 178/8. <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The chase for one for the record books, as Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill stitched together the joint-highest partnership for India in T20I&#39;s</strong></span>, helping India ease the chase and get across the line with 3 overs to spare!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rovman Powell, West Indies Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;It&#39;s a pretty good batting surface and we were maybe 10-15 runs short. We didn&#39;t stick to our plans. We didn&#39;t bat well in the middle overs, if we can improve against spin we can do well.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;There are more Indians here and the way they have been supporting, they make sure that we give them some entertainment. Going forward, we&#39;ll have to take responsibility as batters and help our bowlers. Shubman and Yashasvi were brilliant. All these games give us a lot of confidence. We had to pull up our socks and play good cricket, and that&#39;s exactly what the boys did. Tomorrow we turn up and do exactly what we did today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Yashasvi Jaiswal is the Player of the Match.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Yashasvi Jaiswal:</strong></span> &quot;I am happy to go out there and perform. I try to play how the team needs. I try to score quickly in the powerplay. Reading the wicket, reading the situation, everything is important. I have played a lot of balls against Holder and McCoy. Gill was really amazing and batted really well. I want to thank everyone for coming here and supporting us.&quot;</p>\n",

Thanks to Pooran and the team. The plan was especially to take wickets. We have been through hard times in the last few months and this means a lot to us.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, India Captain:</strong></span> &quot;We lost the momentum when I came in and couldn&#39;t capitalize on the momentum. We try to get better. On the positive side, we have got a lot of learnings. The boys showed character and credit to them. Every youngster who is coming in is showing character and I can&#39;t be more happy when I see a youngster coming in and putting his hand up.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rovman Powell, West Indies Captain:</strong></span> &quot;The people in the Caribbean were longing for something nice. Credit to the coaching side, we could have easily panicked after the loss. I am very big on individual performances and if one can perform, the team will benefit. Credit to the bowling unit, they controlled this powerful batting lineup from India. A lot of credit has to go to the fans, when the chips were down they supported us. Thanks to everyone for supporting us.&quot;</p>\n",

A new look Indian Unit will take up the Irish Challenge under a new leader in Jasprit Bumrah. The wait is finally over as the Indian Pacer returns to International Cricket after 327 days in order to have some valuable game time before the Asia Cup which starts later this month. Ruturaj Gaikwad will be his deputy while Shivam Dube makes a comeback in the Indian Colours after three years. Prasidh Krishna who returns to competitive cricket after sustaining a back injury might make his T20I debut while the likes of Rinku Singh and Jitesh Sharma too can be seen in the blue outfit this series. The hosts Ireland under the leadership of their new Skipper Paul Stirling would look to register their first win against the Men in blue as they have fallen short on all 5 occasions in the past while the Indian Unit full of exciting talents would look to make an impression before the Asia cup and an all Important World Cup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\nThese two teams have faced each other five times, and The Men in Blue<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/india.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> have come out victorious on all five occasions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong><br />\nAverage 1st innings Score: 184/6<br />\nPar Score at the venue: 212<br />\nHighest Total: 225/7 (by India vs Ireland, 2022)<br />\nLowest Total: 70 All-Out (Ireland vs India, 2018)</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India has gone past 200 every time they batted first at the Venue.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong><br />\n<strong>Rohan Gavaskar: &quot;We will get some pace, bounce, and runs too. There is a night sprinkling of grass which means it will seam around giving the overcast conditions. But if batters can get their eye in, they can score big runs.

You realize what you have been missing when you are away from it, very happy to be back. We expect nothing short of a fight from Ireland. As a fast bowler, I hope the pitch does something. Looks like it will.

Jasprit Bumrah playing a game after 327 days looked in good rhythm while Prasidh Krishna managed to scalp two on his T20 Debut. Ravi Bishnoi too chipped in with crucial wickets. A partnership of 57(44) for the 7th wicket helped Ireland get to a respectable total of 139 in the end. In response, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ruturaj Gaikwad started well scoring 45 in the powerplay which put India ahead of the opposition.

There was some help due to the weather as well. In every game, you would want more. They played well, after a crisis, they played well to stitch a partnership. Credit where it is due. Even when you win, there are areas to improve on. Everybody is very confident, they are very well prepared.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Rain Gods played spoilsport in the first T20I where the Indian Unit managed to win the game by 2 runs on the DLS. Indian Unit which is full of new faces would be eager to have a full game of Cricket to express themselves in the middle while the Hometeam which did have a few good moments in the first match would be looking to put up a good fight on their own soil.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\nThese two teams have faced each other six times, and The Men in Blue have come out victorious on all six occasions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong><br />\nAverage 1st innings Score: 184/6<br />\nPar Score at the venue: 212<br />\nHighest Total: 225/7 (by India vs Ireland, 2022)<br />\nLowest Total: 70 All-Out (Ireland vs India, 2018)</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India has gone past 200 every time they batted first at the Venue.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report:<br />\nRohan Gavaskar: &quot;Overcast conditions are no longer there, the pitch looks dry, good for a game of cricket.

The weather is a little better today and we wanted to put runs on the board. The body is good, was a little careful in the beginning, and then after that kept on building confidence and it was good.

Jaiswal and Ruturaj Gaikwad came out all guns blazing after India was asked to bat first by the hosts. Gaikwad then formed a crucial partnership with Sanju Samson to steady the ship in the middle overs. The stylish opener went on to score 58 while Samson scored 40 at a strike rate of 153. Rinku Singh provided the impetus that was required at the back end of the innings smashing 38 at a staggering strike rate of 181. Chasing 186 Ireland lost 3 of their top four within the powerplay and never really recovered from that point. Andy Balbernie scoring 72 (51) was the only batter who put up a fight against a competent Indian bowling attack. Jasprit Bumrah picking 2 wickets for just 15 runs was the pick of the bowlers while Prasidh Krishna and Ravi Bishnoi chipped in with two wickets. Ireland was bundled out for 152 falling short by 33 runs.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rinku Singh is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rinku Singh: &quot;I am feeling good.

We had positives for the entire 40 overs. I think we just let them get away in the last few overs. Their batters got in and were difficult to bowl at. We have areas to work on. We can turn it around in the last game and hopefully get a win.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Jasprit Bumrah, Indian Skipper: &quot; I am feeling good. Today was a little drier. We thought it would get slower and hence batted first. It is very pleasing when things go your way. It is tough to pick an XI where there is so much talent. Great headache to have to be honest. Everyone is eager and wants a chance. Everyone is confident as well. &nbsp;If you play with the baggage of expectations, you are under pressure right from the start. You have to keep those expectations aside and focus on the task at hand.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the third game of Asia Cup 2023. The arch-rivals India and Pakistan will go head to head at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Sri Lanka. The last time the two teams faced off in an ODI was in the 2019 World Cup in England where the Men in blue got the better of the opposition. It is a treat for the fans that India and Pakistan might meet three times in the tournament. Pakistan will enter the contest on the back of a win against Nepal but will not take anything for granted against a full-strength Indian Unit. The weather is expected to be a factor in this high-octane encounter but the rain has eased since yesterday and we do have a game on our hands between the Asian heavyweights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key battles to watch out for:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">Shaheen Shah Afridi</span> vs <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">Haris Rauf</span> vs <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Virat Kohli</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Kuldeep Yadav</span> vs <span style=\"color:#16a085\">Babar Azam</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:<br />\nIndia and Pakistan have clashed in 132 ODIs. &nbsp;India has won 55 games whereas Pakistan has come out victorious on 73 occasions. Four of the matches have ended in No result.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:<br />\nSanjay Manjrekar: &quot;A high quality and unique looking pitch. Fast bowlers can get some seam movement, the spinners will get some turn as well, and a good batter can also score a century on this wicket if he gets his eye in. With DLS in consideration, the captain winning the toss might prefer to field first.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India wins the toss and elects to bat&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />first!</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper: &quot; We are going to bat. There is a bit of weather around, but can&#39;t think much about it. You have to play good cricket, you need to embrace the challenge, embrace the situation. We had some time off after the West Indies series. Everyone was up for those drills and challenges in Bangalore. Let&#39;s see what we can achieve in this tournament. It&#39;s a quality tournament with quality opposition. At the end of the day, we need to see what we can achieve as a team. Shreyas Iyer comes back, Jasprit Bumrah is back and we have three seamers. Got two spinners - Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Skipper: &quot; We would have batted first, but the toss is not in our hands. We have played a lot of cricket here, so we know the conditions. Top teams are playing so Asia Cup is good. We&#39;ll try to do our best. We are playing with the same combination, with no changes. Performing well always gives you confidence, we&#39;ll try to capitalize. It&#39;s a high-intensity match, we&#39;ll try to be calm and composed.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Rain plays spoil sport in what could have been an exciting game of Cricket. This means that both teams get one point each and Pakistan advances to super fours. It is unfortunate that we got to see just one innings in this highly anticipated clash between India and Pakistan. India will now face Nepal in a couple of days&#39; time on the 4th of September.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n",

Men in Blue will play against Nepal for the first time in International Cricket. A win today will confirm a spot for Rohit Sharma and Co. in the super four whereas the Asia Cup debutants Nepal on the other side would look to pose a tough challenge after their spirited performance against Pakistan in their series opener.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Milestone:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Virat Kohli needs 98 runs to complete 13000 ODI runs!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong><br />\n<strong>Sanjay Manjrekar and Matthew Hayden: &quot;The same Wicket India played Pakistan. The pitch looks really flat. Around a good length, it falls away a little bit and then rises up, that&#39;s why the pacers are getting variable bounce on this surface. The spinners will have some assistance too. It looks nice and dry.

No particular reason. We batted first in the last match. We want to see what the bowlers have to offer for us. I don&#39;t know about the weather. We just want to have the bowlers to have a game under their belt. The way we batted under pressure, Hardik and Ishan batted brilliantly. Ishan showed a lot of maturity and took the game on as well. Good signs for us. It&#39;s another important game for us. One change. Bumrah is not available, we&#39;ve got Shami in place for him.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>Rohit Paudel, Nepal Skipper: &quot; We were looking to bowl as well due to the overhead conditions. Today is the biggest day for Nepal cricket. Great opportunity for us. One change, In place of Aarif Sheikh, Bhim Sharki comes in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Aasif Sheikh 58(97) and Sompal Kami 48(56) top scored for Nepal getting the team total to 230. Ravindra Jadeja picking 3 wickets for just 40 runs was the pick of the bowlers. It was just 2 overs in the run chase when it started drizzling and the revised target of 145 from 23 overs was in front of the Indian Batting Unit.

Our lower order has been doing a great job and contributing in the last four to five months. The conditions were really hard but our bowlers bowled well as the ball was not gripping that much.

When we came here we knew what our World Cup 15 was going to be like, the Asia Cup was not going to give us a picture because it was only two games. But luckily we got to bat in the first game and bowl in this game, which made it a complete game for us. A lot of guys coming back from injuries and they need time to get back into the groove, we do understand that. Hardik Pandya and Ishan Kishan were very good in the last game to get us to that score against Pakistan. The bowling was okay today but the fielding was below par, we need to improve on that and look into it.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

The arch rivals&#39; previous encounter was washed away due to rain but this Super Four round does have a reserve day in place for the fans to have another chance to cherish this epic clash. &nbsp;India come into the game after a clinical performance against Nepal whereas Pakistan on the other end won their previous Super Four encounter against Bangladesh in their own backyard. One can expect a turning track at Colombo where even the batters can showcase their shot-making abilities. All in all one can expect a thriller of a contest between the Men in Blue and Men in Green in the all-important Asia Cup encounter.

Five matches ended without a result.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong><br />\n<strong>Sanjay Manjrekar and Waqar Younis</strong>: &quot;The sun is out, and there is not any grey cloud in the sky. The curators also watered the wicket, so that is an indication that the weather might have changed. We&#39;ve got a bit of grass cover on this track as well. The pitch might have a little for the Pace bowlers with the new ball, and the spinners will get a little purchase because of the moisture underneath.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<strong>Pakistan wins the toss and elects to field first <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">Babar Azam, Pakistan Skipper: &quot; We will field first. I think there is a bit of moisture which will help our bowlers, we need to use that early on. Always, India Pakistan is a high-intensity contest, but we will take it match to match. As a team, we are playing good cricket, we are focused on this one too. No changes for us&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper: &quot; Was looking to bat. There will be a challenge upfront with the new ball, but the way we guys batted last time around gives us confidence. Every game is important for us, but one thing at a time to focus on. we had a break due to rain but that&#39;s the nature of the sport, it gave us a good time to prepare and now we&#39;ll look to play well. Two changes to the side Jasprit Bumrah is back and one forced change is Shreyas Iyer who just got a back spasm so KL Rahul comes in for him.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

All the boxes ticked outclassing Pakistan in all three departments. Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill were quick to get off the blocks while Virat Kohli and KL Rahul were simply magical to watch. A 233-run stand between the duo demoralised the Pakistani attack putting Men in Blue in the driver&#39;s seat. A target of 357 was never going to be an easy task on a wicket that had assistance for both seamers and spinners. Indian Pacers started well keeping the scoring in check but the damage was done in the second powerplay where almost every second ball was going past the outside edge of the Pakistani batters. Hardik Pandya getting the ball to cut off the surface proved to be a tough nut to crack for the opposition. Just when the seamers made the going tough for the batters, Kuldeep Yadav using his variety of tricks ran through the middle &amp; lower order singlehandedly. The wrist-spinner accounted for 5 wickets for just 25 runs from his eight overs. Pakistan eventually was bundled out for just 128 runs falling short by 228 runs which is the highest margin defeat for them against the Men in Blue!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Babar Azam, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/pakistan.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; Weather is something that is not in our hands but we tried our best. Batting and bowling today were not up to the mark. Indian openers had plans for our bowlers and started well which was followed up by Virat Kohli and KL Rahul in the middle overs. New ball bowlers bowled well in the first powerplay swinging the ball both ways which made it tough for our batters.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/india.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We just wanted to get out on the field, to get some match time. A lot of guys have not had that. That could only happen thanks to a great effort from the groundsmen. I know how tough it is to cover and remove covers from the whole ground. On behalf of the entire team, we would like to thank the ground staff. Considering our batting, &nbsp;Fantastic performance, right from yesterday. When we started, we knew the wicket was good and we had to adjust to the rain, The two experienced guys Kohli and Rahul knew they&#39;d take time to get their eyes in and then we could get going. Jasprit Bumrah looked good, he swung it both ways and he&#39;s worked really hard for the last 8-10 months. He is only 27, so for him to miss games isn&#39;t ideal but the way he bowled showed what he is all about. Looking at how we batted, there were lots of positives with the openers and then Kohli and KL. Virat&#39;s innings was brilliantly paced. And then KL, to get back from injury and then to know 5 minutes before the toss he&#39;s playing, to play that way shows the mindset of the player.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/crown.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />Virat Kohli &quot;</strong>I</span><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> was going to ask you to keep the interview short, I&#39;m very tired. I&#39;m always prepared to help the team in different ways. Today, KL got a great start and my job was just to rotate strike. I take a lot of pride in trying to push for easy runs, pushing for a double is as easy as they come. (On the reverse ramp boundary) Because I crossed the 100, there was a bit of respect for that shot. I don&#39;t play shots like that and I looked very bad playing it. Me and KL are both conventional cricketers, We don&#39;t try fancy stuff but we can get a lot of purchases through good cricket shots. A great partnership and a good sign for Indian cricket. Very happy for him to come back to ODI cricket in that manner. About playing tomorrow,&nbsp; I was pushing for those runs and happy for it, but I was thinking I need to play at 3 p.m. tomorrow. Luckily, we are Test players, I&#39;ve played over 100 Tests so I know how to come back and play the next day. It was really humid out there, I&#39;m 35 in November so I need to be taking care of that recovery as well. A big shout-out to the groundsmen from my side, I think they did a fabulous job.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

Both teams come into this contest on the back of wins in their respective games. Sri Lanka went past Bangladesh while the Men in Blue handed a heavy defeat to Arch Rivals Pakistan in the previous match. Winning against a top side in Pakistan will definitely boost India&#39;s confidence but the challenge here is the recovery from the game played yesterday and maintaining the same fitness levels is a task in its own. The fact that all the departments were at their best will make Rohit Sharma a happy captain. All the batters looked in good nick of things while the bowlers too were on top of their game. The men in blue have never shied away from challenges and the current squad has players that thrive under pressure in tough scenarios. Winning this game against Sri Lanka which is the home team would put India in a comfortable position in the race to the finals of the Asia Cup 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head to Head:</strong><br />\nIndia and Sri Lanka have encountered in 165 ODIs. &nbsp;Men in Blue have won 96 matches whereas Sri Lanka has come out victorious on 57 occasions.

Whenever rain has not been around, cricket has been attractive and spectacular to watch because of the pace. When you look at the bounce in all the venues it is pretty high and has a similar kind of bounce, there&#39;s no low and slow bounce. The impact of pacers in this Asia Cup is huge as they have picked 70 percent of the wickets. The Wicket today is looking a lot different from the India-Pakistan pitch that was used yesterday. No grass on this one. This track looks a lot like the Premadasa of the old years. This has no grass and I have a feeling it will have an abrasive effect on the ball.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma,<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/india.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We are going to have a bat. Playing on successive days is tough but that&#39;s the challenge you come across as a sportsman, different challenges thrown at you as a player and as a team. We ensured everyone got into the pool after the game last night for much-needed recovery. They are fresh as we had five days off before these two games. The last game was good for us, we batted well and then came out to defend the total with some good bowling. But again this is a new day and a fresh match. The pitch looks different, looks a lot drier and there&#39;s no grass hence we bring in Axar Patel for Shardul Thakur. It might assist the spinners but we also have three quality pacers.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/sri-lanka.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We would have batted first as well.

The top order was back in the pavilion with just 25 runs on the board. Thereafter it was the spinners that not only kept the scoring in check but also kept chipping in with wickets at regular intervals. Wellalage and De Silva kept the Sri Lankan hopes alive but ultimately succumbed under pressure conceding the game by 41 runs.&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/india.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> has made it to the Finals of Asia Cup 2023!<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/trophy.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Sri Lanka&#39;s 13-match winning streak in ODI has ended and the Indian Team makes it to the finals of the Asia Cup for the 10th time!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/sri-lanka.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;We didn&#39;t expect this kind of a track, I thought it was a batting wicket but we adjusted well, especially Wellalage, De Silva, and Asalanka. We have the luxury of two genuine batters who can roll their arms if needed, They have been bowling in the nets and I know their real potential, today I had the option of using them today.

Challenged a lot of aspects of our game. We definitely want to play on tracks like this to see what we can achieve. Hardik Pandya has worked hard on his bowling over the last couple of years, and it&#39;s pleasing to see how he bowled that spell. Not an easy target to defend, to be honest. The pitch got slightly better towards the end so we had to hold our nerve and bowl consistently. Kuldeep Yadav for the past year or so has been bowling really well. He&#39;s worked hard on his rhythm and you can see the results in the last 10-15 ODIs he&#39;s played. He gives us a lot of options.

If you look at the numbers, spin bowlers have done better under lights taking 19 wickets at an average of 21.1. It has a lighter colour pitch as compared to the one beside it. It&#39;s a very hard surface with lots of grass cover. There will be good bounce as well. Spinners will play a part but it really looks like a good wicket to bat on.

Pacers who bend their back in the daytime have also got movement and there have been assistance for the spinners. You have to be brave enough to play your natural game. We got to give some match time to some other guys who haven&#39;t played. We have made 5 changes. Virat, Hardik, Siraj, Bumrah and Kuldeep miss out. Tilak Verma makes his ODI debut.

The 100-run partnership between the skipper Shakib (80 off 85) and T Hridoy (54 off 81) revived their innings after which the lower order of Bangladesh contributed well to take their score to 265 runs. In the second innings, the Bangladesh bowlers put pressure on their opposition by taking two crucial wickets in the first powerplay. One end was tightly held by Shubman Gill who went on to register his 5th ODI ton. With the team reaching closer to the target, &nbsp;Mahedi picked the key wicket of S Gill.

The two successful teams in the tournament&#39;s history face off again in another final. This will be the Men in Blue&#39;s 10th Asia Cup Final and they will look to add to their tally of 7 Asia Cup titles. This will also be <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>skipper Rohit Sharma&#39;s 250th ODI</strong></span> and will look to make it a memorable outing. There are a couple of injuries in each camp, with Washington Sundar coming into the squad for Axar Patel and Sahan Arachchige replacing Maheesh Theekshana for the Lankan Lions</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>WE HAVE A DELAY IN THE START OF THE MATCH DUE TO RAIN AND PLAY WILL START AT 3:40 PM!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Both teams have won 10 matches each in the history of the Asia Cup but India has the edge coming into the final winning the most recent encounter and 4 of the last 5 matches.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Batting First teams have won 4 of the 5 matches played so far this tournament. The Average 1st Innings score this tournament is 269 with both the pacers and spinners picking up 50% of the wickets. Will we see the team winning the toss opt to bat first again?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sanjay Manjrekar, Dominic Cork:</strong> &quot;A Fresh pitch for the final. The pitches here have generally been useful for the spinners. It is a dry surface with hardly any grass on it and 70m boundaries in all directions. It&#39;ll be better to bat first and then hope for some turn at night.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>SRI LANKA HAVE WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO BAT!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka Skipper: </strong></span>&quot;We will bat first. Seems like a good wicket and there will be some turn in the afternoon. I am very pleased with all the youngsters, Wellalage, Pathirana, and Samarawickrama. It is a good team and the results are there to show. This is a good boost for the World Cup. <strong>We have one change, Theekshana misses out, and Dushan Hemantha comes in.</strong>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</span> </strong>&quot;We would have batted first too but we are confident of chasing down whatever Sri Lanka put on the board. This is a good chance to be aggressive with the ball and see what the surface has to offer. The crowds here have been brilliant and hopefully, they get to witness a good final. <strong>Everyone&#39;s back after the rest. Axar is injured so Washington Sundar comes in for him.</strong>&quot;</p>\n",

After being put on the field, the new ball pair of Bumrah and Siraj breathed fire, with Bumrah picking up a wicket in the 3rd ball of the match, after which it was carnage from Siraj as he picked up 4 wickets in an over, 5 wickets in just 16 balls and ended with 6 to his name. Hardik Pandya picked up 3 wickets in the end to bundle out Sri Lanka for 50. In the chase, Ishan Kishan was sent out to open alongside Shubman Gill and the duo completed the chase in 6.1 overs, to register <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India&#39;s highest victory margin by balls remaining in ODI&#39;s</strong></span>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mohammed Siraj is the Player of the Match</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mohammed Siraj:</strong> &quot;Have been bowling well for a long time and was missing the edges earlier. The wicket was seaming and there was swing also today. Thought I could bowl fuller because of the swing. This cash prize goes to the groundsmen. This tournament wouldn&#39;t have been possible without them.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kuldeep Yadav is the Player of the Series</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Kuldeep Yadav:</strong> &quot;Been working on my rhythm for the last one and half years. It&#39;s not about wickets but just about the lengths and have worked hard on that. Credit goes to Rohit Sharma, he encouraged me to work on my speed.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>Dasun Shanaka, Sri Lanka Captain:</strong></span> &quot;Tough day for us at the office. I thought it&#39;d be a good pitch for batters, but overcast conditions played a part. Lots of positives in the tournament. The way Sadeera and Kusal batted against spin, and also the way Asalanka batted. I would like to thank supporters who came in numbers and for the great support.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain:</strong></span> &quot;To come out and play like that in the final shows the mental character. Great start with the ball and a clinical finish with the bat. It was good to see that. Siraj has to be given a lot of credit, rare for seamers to move the ball in the air and off the pitch. We did everything we could achieve as a team in this tournament. The way Hardik and Ishan batted in that pressure situation against Pakistan, and then KL and Virat getting hundreds, the way Gill has been batting. The guys have stood up at various stages.&quot;</p>\n",

The first game will take place at Mohali while the second and the third will be held at &nbsp;Indore and Rajkot respectively. The hosts India enter this contest on the back of a successful Asia Cup campaign while the Aussies suffered a 3-2 defeat against South Africa in an away series. With the World Cup just around the corner, this series will serve as a perfect platform for both sides to test their bench strength and find the right balance on Indian pitches. The men in Blue will be without the service of Skipper Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya, and Kuldeep Yadav in the first two matches which means KL Rahul will lead the side alongside Jasprit Bumrah as his deputy. The Kangaroos will welcome the back of Steven Smith, Pat Cummins, and Glenn Maxwell to the side while all eyes will be on Ravi Ashwin who might play an ODI after 18 months in the blue colours.

The bowlers kept things tight giving nothing away and were successful in drying out the boundaries. Shami delivered whenever the ball was thrown to him, getting the wicket of a set Steve Smith proved to be the turning point in the first innings. The pacer went on to register his best ODI figures getting 5 for just 51. In response to 276, The new opening pair of Gill and Gaikwad played some delightful strokes using all their elegance and class. The duo put together 142 for the first wicket and set the platform for the middle order to follow. Gaikwad accounted for 71 while Gill scored 74 at a strike rate of 117. Australia did come back picking 3 wickets in the middle-over phase but a partnership of 80 between Skipper KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav had India in the driver&#39;s seat. India sealed the game in the 49th over with 5 wickets remaining.

A few guys batted well and a few guys bowled well. The guys who are injured will probably not be ready for the second game, maybe the third game. Maxwell has just arrived in India.

It gets tough and physically challenging, but we&#39;ve all worked on our fitness and that&#39;s showing on the field. We only played five bowlers, so they had to bowl 10 overs. After Shubman Gill got out, it was a bit tricky with the set batter out. But managed to build a good partnership with SKY. We kept talking about hitting good cricket shots, rotating the strike and this is something all our batters are working on. We didn&#39;t want to get bogged down, we were always on par so we wanted to take it deep.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammad Shami &nbsp;is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammad Shami: &quot;It depends on the Skipper and the game situation when he wants you to bowl, but despite the heat, you feel like bowling 4-5 overs at least, with the new ball. I enjoyed the wicket of Mitchell Marsh, that&#39;s a different feeling when you get the outside edge when you control your swing nicely early on. It was important to hit the right lengths on this wicket. The bowling attack is good, especially alongside Bumrah We&#39;ve played together for a long time, so we know what needs to be done. Always enjoy when we bowl well in tandem like this&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Skipper KL Rahul and Ishan Kishan also contributed with the bat but the finishing touch was provided by Suryakumar Yadav who made 72 from just 37 deliveries dismantling the Aussie bowling attack to pieces. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/australia.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> were already on the backfoot as India registered their highest ODI total of 399 and losing 2 wickets on consecutive deliveries of Prasidh Krishna did not make things easy. David Warner did get to a fifty but lacked support from the other end. Indian Spinners especially R Ashwin gave nothing away and also kept chipping in with Wickets at regular intervals. Sean Abbott who came in 8 did strike a few out of the park but could not get the job done. Ashwin and Jaddu picked 3 wickets a piece and summed up the Aussie innings at a deficit of 99 runs (DLS).</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Steve Smith, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/australia.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;When we came here it looked like a good pitch. Credit to them, Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer batted beautifully and took that game away from us. The way KL Rahul and SKY batted was brilliant to watch. After the rain, it got sticky and it started to spin as well. We have lost quite a few matches in a row, in South Africa and here. We need to sort out a few things, hopefully, we turn it around in the next game. We have a few off days now, we are working towards the WC. Hopefully, we&#39;ll turn it around in the third game.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/india.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; When I saw the wicket in the morning, I didn&#39;t think it would turn so much. Putting 400 on the board gives you immense confidence. It&#39;s not really our decision to make. &nbsp;Everyone who gets picked in the eleven needs to focus on their job. Everyone has gone through this, you need to keep getting better and wait for the opportunities. We have dropped a few catches, but fielding under lights is challenging physically. The coaches are doing their best to keep the guys fit. Sometimes these mistakes happen. The commitment is always there and we&#39;ll learn from it, brush it off, and get better in the next game. With the World Cup only a couple of weeks away, guys will want to get into it. They need to get used to the challenges, they will be keen to get back on to the field.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer &nbsp;is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer: &quot;It was a rollercoaster ride and I am feeling fantastic. My teammates, friends, and family were there to support me. I was seeing the matches on TV, I wanted to be out there and participate in the matches. Grateful to be believing in myself. The pain and niggles kept on coming, but I knew what I was aiming for. Glad that I was able to execute my plans perfectly tonight. Basically, when I went in to bat, I didn&#39;t want to complicate things. I wanted to get my eyes set, that&#39;s how I give confidence to myself. I am flexible, ready to bat any position, whatever my team needs to do&quot;.</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the Live commentary of ODI three between INDIA&nbsp;and AUSTRALIA at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Rajkot. The Men in Blue have already won the series ticking all their boxes right before the all-important World Cup. The good news for the side is that Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Kuldeep Yadav return to the side eyeing a whitewash against a competitive Australian Unit which might see their star players like Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins return to their lineup. Indian side which is now the number one ranked side across all formats would like to create history by registering their first-ever Whitewash against the Aussies in the ODI format. This match will most likely serve as a perfect rehearsal for both sides before the 2023 World Cup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Brad Haddin and Sanjay Manjrekar:</strong> &quot; Looks like a lush green outfield. With 66m and 67m being the square boundaries 79m hit down the ground. &quot;Beautiful covering of grass and it&#39;s very even. It&#39;s an even surface which is a lot harder than the previous games. <strong>The average first innings score is 311</strong>. I think there will be a lot more skid than spin.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\">AUSTRALIA&nbsp; wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first!</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Pat Cummins, Australian&nbsp;Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;We will have a bat. Looks like a good track, not sure how it&rsquo;ll change in the 100 overs. Good to get game time for everyone, don&rsquo;t want to go into a World Cup cold. Results haven&rsquo;t gone our way until now but good day to change that. Different conditions here but we have played a lot over here so no surprises. We&rsquo;ve made five changes, Starc and Maxwell are back. Tanveer Sangha is making his ODI debut.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian&nbsp;Skipper: &quot; Conditions are much better here, the weather looks good. Decent temperature as well, we&rsquo;re just looking forward to this game. The breaks are more important from a mental perspective than a physical one. Very happy with how we played in the series, almost everything we wanted to do we got it done. Gives us a chance for us to see what we want to do. Looks a bit dry, it&rsquo;s going to play slightly better under lights, we wanted to chase anyway. Let&#39;s see if we can make use of the two new balls. Myself, Virat Kohli, and Kuldeep Yadav are back. From the last game, Ravi Ashwin misses out, and Washington Sundar is in. Ishan Kishan is not well, he&rsquo;s down with viral fever so he misses out.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The Australian openers came out all guns blazing after winning the toss and deciding to bat first. Mitchell Marsh and David Warner added 78 runs for the first wicket going at a brisk rate. Thereafter Steven Smith and Mitch Marsh continued on the momentum adding 137 ( 119) for the second wicket taking the game away from the Indian bowlers. Marsh top scored with 96 while Steve Smith and Marnus coming in at no.3 &amp; 4 added 74 &amp; 72 respectively. India had a huge ask ahead of them in order to get past a total of 352 which happens to be the highest total at the venue. Skipper Rohit Sharma took the attack onto the opposition smashing 81 from 57 deliveries but none of the other batters could cope up with the asking rate. Glenn Maxwell getting the key wickets of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Shreyas Iyer was the pick of the bowlers. The all-rounder accounted for 4 wickets conceding just 40 runs from his 10. Australia eventually won the game by 66 runs. The two teams will once again clash in their first World Cup game which will take place on the 8th of October in Chennai.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Pat Cummins, Australia Skipper: &quot; I must say I&#39;m quite happy to bowl in the night than in the heat during the day. Both Maxwell and Starc have not played much, Maxi picking four-fer and Starcy bowling in great rhythm is a good sign. Travis Head won&#39;t be fit for the start of the WC. I will be pretty worried about opening the bowling against a pair like Warner &amp; Mitch Marsh. Ashton Agar is back home with a calf injury and Head won&#39;t be fit for the next couple of weeks. Happy as it was the first hit where we have had almost a full-strength team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Glenn Maxwell &nbsp;is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Glenn Maxwell: &quot;Not too bad, is it? It has been a lot of hard work, to be honest. The South Africa tour was a bit of a setback for us. After the injury got back home and got an injection. I don&#39;t have any travel issues, unlike the others. I feel fresh. It&#39;s nice to chip in, if Mitch Marsh was there on the field, we would have chopped and changed in the bowling. Since he was not there, had to bowl more. That will be the role of the allrounders in this WC. We are all trying to be as flexible as possible. We have a super flexible list and it&#39;s good to get some momentum before the World Cup.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper: &quot; I&#39;m pretty happy of course I would like to go all the way along but if I&#39;m hitting like that I&#39;m pretty happy. In the last 7-to 8 days we have played really well, we have been challenged under different conditions and by different teams, and I thought we responded to that challenge quite well. Unfortunately, not the result we wanted today. About Jasprit Bumrah I&#39;m pretty happy, more importantly how he feels body-wise, he has got so much skill, one bad game can happen to anyone. How he feels mentally and body-wise is key for us and that&#39;s looking good for us. When we talk about the 15 we are very clear about what we want. We are not confused, we know where we are headed as a team. It&#39;s a team sport and we want everyone to come and play their part, that&#39;s how we win championships. It&#39;s about looking after the body and trying and stay fresh for the next one and half months.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The Men in Blue earned a direct ticket into the semi-finals being a high-ranked side while Nepal made their way after convincing wins against Mongolia and Maldives in the group stage of the Asian Games 2023. The team from Nepal will enter the contest on the back of winning momentum but it would be a daunting task against the Ruturaj Gaikwad-led Indian Unit which possesses some exciting T20 Talent. Batters <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, and Rahul Tripathi have showcased their striking capabilities in the IPL and one can expect India to score big on a ground that is not the biggest. The Bowling Unit comprising of Pacers Arshdeep Singh, Mukesh Kumar, and Avesh Khan; Spinners Ravi Bishnoi, and Washington Sundar can cause troubles for any batting unit let alone Nepal which lacks experience in facing tougher opposition. Will India sail through or Nepal will pose a tough challenge, we shall know just in a bit, let the game begin!&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Venue:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pingfeng Campus Cricket Field, Hangzhou</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first</strong></span></p>\n",

Gaikwad&#39;s decision to bat first came off as Yashasvi Jaiswal took the attack onto the opposition from the word go. A 100-run stand between the openers set the right platform for the middle order to follow. Jaiswal accumulated a brilliant 100 from 49 balls with 8 fours and 7 sixes. The finishing touch was provided by Rinku Singh who smashed an unbeaten 37 at a strike rate of 246. 203 was never going to be easy to chase especially after not being able to make the powerplay count. Nepal batters were not allowed to score freely as the score was just 46 in six overs. The batters did comeback in the middle overs scoring at 9 r.p.o but kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Ravi Bishnoi&#39;s googlies and sliders left the Nepal batters baffled. The leggie accounted for 3 scalps for just 24 runs. A good second spell from Avesh Khan and Shivam Dube managed to restrict the scoring rate at the death. Nepal showed heart and played competitive cricket but fell short by 23 runs in the end.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n",

The young Indian team is of full confidence in getting the gold medal for the team and are just two steps away from achieving it.

The last time a World Cup happened in India Dhoni finished it off in style, and with the last 3 World Cups being won by the host nation, the Men in Blue will have their eyes on the prize. <strong>Since the 2019 World Cup, the two teams have met 12 times and have won 6 matches each, however, India has the momentum leading into the contest winning the 3-match series against the Aussies just before the World Cup.

Australia and Pat Cummins called it right at the toss and opted to bat first, after which Bumrah got an early breakthrough for the Men in Blue removing the dangerous Mitchell Marsh, and later on in the innings the Indian spinners used the conditions perfectly, and picked up wickets in the middle overs to restrict the run-flow, bundling out Australia for 199. In the chase, the Aussies breathed fire&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/fire.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> with the ball, picking up three wickets inside the first two overs and dismissing three of the Indian top 4 for ducks, after which the chase master Virat Kohli and KL Rahul stitched together a 165-run partnership, with both of them scoring half-centuries to ease the chase and helping India get off the mark in the World Cup <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/explosion.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins, Australia Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;At least 50 short with the bat, it was tough trying to defend anything under 200. Their spinners made it tough to work out there. Hazlewood is a class bowler and possesses a lot of questions, stays in that area and was fantastic today. Just one game out of nine, not too much to ponder about but there are some areas we need to get better.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;Good feeling to come out on top, it was a good game to start the tournament. Our bowlers used the conditions perfectly, the spinners bowled in the nice areas and all in all, it was a great effort. Credit to Virat and KL on how they went about the chase. That is going to be a challenge for us as a team, moving to different conditions and adapting, and whoever suits the conditions will have to come and do the job. Chennai never disappoints, they love their cricket, and for them to sit in that heat and come out and cheer the team says a lot.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul is the Player of the Match<br />\nKL Rahul:</strong></span> &quot;I was just trying to get my breath back. Virat said there&rsquo;s a bit in the wicket, so play like Test cricket for a while. There was a bit of help for the pacers with the new ball and then the spinners also. In the last 15-20 overs, dew played a part and that helped quite a bit. It was a good cricket wicket, that&rsquo;s what you get in the south of India, especially Chennai.&quot;</p>\n",

Have to read the conditions and figure out who&#39;s the right guy to do the job. We were very clear about what we wanted to do. All in all, it&#39;s looking good. Want to keep my fingers crossed.

This week is full of twists and turns with Afghanistan beating England and Netherlands getting the better of South Africa. In the last four matches when these two teams faced, it was Bangladesh who won three of them including the Asia Cup. It&#39;s a sweet time for India to reply back with a World Cup victory!! India are going strong with a hat-trick of victories and Bangladesh lost their previous two games! Who will turn victorious today?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong><br />\nMaharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune<br />\nIn the last 5 ODIs,<br />\n<strong>Teams won&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> First - 3<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;First - 2<br />\nAverage Score - 299</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sanjay Manjrekar and Irfan Pathan:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s a good pitch and has a history of lot of runs. It&#39;s a pitch where the seamers could get help. Not a turner. You can bat really well. If you are a quality fast bowler, you get something out of it as well. It&#39;s a black soil pitch. High-scoring pitch. You can use the bouncer regularly on this pitch and the batters can play on the up&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>SHANTO CALLS RIGHT AT THE TOSS AND BANGLADESH WILL BAT&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST!!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh Captain: &quot;Feeling proud to lead the side. We will bat today. It is a fresh wicket. It&#39;ll be good for the team If we put up a good score. Shakib is struggling a bit, and Nasum replaces him. We have some great memories against India, hopefully, we continue our form. It&#39;ll be a great match. Another change as Hasan comes in for Taskin.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: &quot;I would have bowled first as well. We are planning to stick with the same plan, don&#39;t see any reason to change it. That Plays a crucial role in this WC, keeping everybody in their own space. The boys are confident and as well as enjoying the cricket. We want to continue this momentum with no change in the Playing XI.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

India was put to bowl first by Bangladesh and the openers of their team T Hasan (51 off 43) and L Das (66 off 82) laid a solid foundation by scoring 93 runs! After which the Indian spinners gave us the breakthrough and this changed the momentum with a few quiet overs from both ends. The finishing from Mahmudullah (46 off 36) gave Bangladesh a total of 256 runs. In the second innings, Rohit and Gill paired up for 88 runs each contributing 48 and 53 to the team.

I thought of finishing the innings and getting the win on a high note and was really hoping to convert my fifty into a hundred. Start always plays a crucial role in an innings, I was lucky to get those kinds of balls at the beginning. It gives you the confidence. It is a good track to bat on and my plan is to bring my game, find the gaps, and accelerate the innings whenever needed. The dressing room feels positive and we love each other&#39;s company and contribution. It is a special World Cup for all of us here, we need to gain and carry the momentum throughout.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Najmul Shanto, Bangladesh Skipper: &quot;India are a very good side and a very capable team. They showed it today. I think we didn&#39;t play our best cricket. Hopefully, we&#39;ll play better in the upcoming games. Tanzid and also our bowlers batted well. The problem is we didn&#39;t finish well with the bat. Would have been a different ball game if Litton had stayed.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper: &quot;Good win, something we were expecting. We didn&#39;t start well, but the guys pulled it back in the middle-overs and at the death. Our fielding has been superb in all these matches. The bowlers were smart and knew what lengths to bowl. Jaddu was brilliant with the ball and the catch. We&#39;re doing well as a group. The crowd is coming in big numbers, the stands are full, and they&#39;ve been brilliant.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello, and a warm welcome to the Super Sunday clash between the table toppers New Zealand and India, the only two unbeaten teams in the tournament yet. New Zealand won their previous four matches with two defending and two chasing while India won all their matches batting second. It might be interesting to see if India bats first in the Dharamsala conditions. Hardik Pandya who suffered an injury in the previous game will not be available today and who do you think will replace him in the xi today? Both teams have met each other 9 times in the World Cup and New Zealand has won 5 out of it with India winning 3. But India has a better overall ODI record. Is it going to be the day of Blackcaps or the Bleedblue? Who will remain unbeaten in the tournament after this exciting encounter?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p>HIMACHAL PRADESH CRICKET ASSOCIATION STADIUM, DHARAMSALA</p>\n\n<p>In 7 ODI&#39;s played here,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Teams won,</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bat First - 3</p>\n\n<p>Bowl First - 4</p>\n\n<p>Average score - 203</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ravi Shastri and Simon Doull:</strong> &quot;Very less grass and this will be on the slower side. Dew will come in. It is a lot cooler here. This pitch will be on the slower side, but still a good wicket to bat on.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>ROHIT SHARMA CALLS RIGHT AT THE TOSS AND INDIA ELECTS TO FIELD FIRST!!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &quot;We opt to bowl first. We were here training yesterday and felt a bit of dew. Looks like a good pitch, we want to chase it. Quite important to keep the momentum going. This is one place where everyone wants to come and play, with beautiful weather and a nice stadium. Hardik is not available and Shardul is out. Shami and Surya make their way in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Tom Latham, New Zealand Skipper: &quot;We would have bowled first as well. Looks a good surface. We know there will be dew later. Whatever we do, we need to do well. We need to keep the momentum going. New conditions, so need to adjust to as quickly as we can. Same team - three seamers and two spinners.&quot;</strong></p>\n",

India opted to bowl first and this became the fifth game where India chased the target and won the match in this CWC. Mohammad Shami who played his first CWC match this year was the star with the ball with a fifer. Rachin Ravindra (75 off 87) and Daryl Mitchell (130 off 127) who paired up after the departure of the openers stayed in the crease till the 34th over contributing 159 runs together. the team then got all out in the last ball of the last over making 273 runs.

The chase master Virat Kohli led the chase scoring 95 runs in 104 deliveries. Jadeja also contributed 39* runs to the victory and sealed the match with 12 balls remaining.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Mohammed Shami is the Player of the Match</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Mohammed Shami: &quot;I gained a lot of confidence after taking a wicket on the very first delivery. You should support your team mates when they are doing well. It was important to pick those late wickets, you always want your team to be the top. Very happy that I got wickets and India is on top of the table.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tom Latham, New Zealand Skipper: &quot;We played quiet well. We didn&#39;t capitalize in the death overs. We lagged a little out there. But credit to India. We weren&#39;t able to get the breakthrough with the ball. Rachin and Mitchell built a fantastic partnership. We have a perfect group. The bowlers did well. We just try to be proactive and focus on the matchups. We have a few days off. We have a day game here. We want to do good stuff.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper: &quot; Very good start to the tournament. Our job is half done. It is important to continue and to stay in the present. Shami took the oppurtunity with both hands, and he has the experience in these conditions. At one stage, we were looking at 300 and more. Credit to our bowlers in the death. I am enjoying my batting. Happy that we won. Kohli has done this for us so many years. Kohli and Jadeja pulled us back when we lost a few wickets in the middle. We know that fielding is something that will decide a lot of things going forward.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the 29th match of the ICC CWC 2023 where the Indian team clash against the defending champions England at Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow. India are the only unbeaten team in the tournament yet and are going really strong in their campaign. They have played five and chased the target successfully in all of those, and it&#39;ll be interesting to see India batting first today. The defending champions, who came in as one of the favourites of the tournament lost their path and are at the bottom of the table currently with just one victory in five of their games. Can England turn their tables around or will India continue their supremacy in the World Cup? Hardik Pandya remains unavailable for today&#39;s game as well. Will India play with their same XI or will we see an extra spinner coming in today?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:-</strong><br />\nBharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow<br />\nIn last 5 ODIs,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Teams won</strong>&nbsp;<br />\nBatting First - 2<br />\nBatting Second - 3<br />\nAverage Score - 258</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>PITCH REPORT:-<br />\nRavi Shastri and Nasser Hussain:</strong> &quot;This looks like a Mumbai track of the 80s and 90s. It&rsquo;s the fourth game at this venue and we can see some wear and tear with some dry patches. Spinners will come into play. Batting will get easier under lights. India is more dangerous when there&rsquo;s spin. It looks like a decent pitch.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>JOS BUTTLER CALLS HEADS AT THE TOSS AND HEADS IT IS!

It&#39;s a great occasion and hopefully, today we bring our best. We want to put up a good show today. We have not played to our full potential. Playing in front of a full crowd and against India, it&#39;s a great feeling. We don&#39;t have any changes today.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Skipper: &quot;We anyhow wanted to bat first, we had a good time batting second and we want to try this. Looks like a good pitch. It has played well for the full match. It&rsquo;s quite important to play well. We have played some good cricket and it&#39;s always good to have a break. It&#39;s nice to come and get back into business. We are going with the same combination.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

After a few initial hiccups, The Indian Skipper Rohit partnered with KL Rahul for 91 runs off 111 deliveries, with Rohit leading the team from the front scoring valuable 87 runs off 101 balls. Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s 49 off 47 took the team to a total of 229 runs. David Willey was the star with the ball in the first innings with him picking three wickets. In the second innings, the Indian pace department showcased a wonderful display taking 4 wickets in the first powerplay. The English team never came back in the game except for a few partnerships. Liam Livingstone scored 27 off 46, the highest of their team. M Shami after a five-wicket haul in the previous game, bowled splendidly today as well accounting for 4 wickets, and J Bumrah took 3 scalps.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma is the Player of the Match</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: &quot;After we lost wickets, it was really important to create that partnership with KL Rahul. It was a challenging pitch, it got better to bat on as the game progressed. Very happy with this win. I have got experience, it is only about playing my shots. I still felt we were 20 runs short. The ball got softer and it wasn&#39;t easy to rotate strike either. This was the game, a lot of character in the squad. We just wanted to get to a total we could play with it. We were not great with the bat. Losing three wickets isn&#39;t the ideal situation. When you start your innings, you have to try and get a couple of wickets to put the pressure back on the opposition. You can always rely on our seamers to come good and get those crucial breakthroughs.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Captain: &quot;We are very disappointed. At the halfway mark, chasing a score of 230, we fancied ourselves, but same old story. I wasn&#39;t sure about the dew. We bowled well. I wanted to soak some pressure and build a partnership. There wasn&#39;t scoreboard pressure. We are just falling short whichever way we are doing it. Excellent start in the powerplay, there was a bit of indifferent bounce, the ground fielding was good. It felt like today was the day, but we didn&#39;t back it up with the bat.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live coverage of India&#39;s Game 7 in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023, against the Lankan Lions as the action moves to the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Only one memory comes to the mind when the words India, Sri Lanka, Mumbai, and World Cup come together but things are a little different this time around as it is a group encounter and the Men in Blue head are undefeated heading into this contest, whereas Sri Lanka will look to improve their semi-final chances with a win. <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India can confirm their spot in the semi-finals with a victory today</strong></span>, becoming the first team to do so.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\nThe two Asian sides have faced each other nine times in World Cups, with both teams winning 4 each. India won both the recent encounters against Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup, bundling out the Lions for just 50 in the Final. Can they continue their winning momentum today also?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The two games in this World Cup had scores of 399 and 382 for the team batting first. The average 1st innings score in the last 5 ODI&#39;s at the venue is 301. <strong>Can we see another high-scoring game here at the Wankhede?</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong><br />\n<strong>Ricky Ponting &amp; Michael Atherton:</strong> &quot;It is the same pitch as the England-South Africa match. 64m and 69m square boundaries, the straight boundary is at 76m. There is a bit of shine and it means that it&#39;ll not slow down as the game progresses. The challenge for the bowlers is to hit a hard length, which has proved difficult to get away.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>Sri Lanka won the toss and have elected to field first.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>Kusal Mendis, Sri Lanka Captain:</strong></span> &quot;We are going to bowl first. The pitch will be better for batting in the second innings. Everyone did their best in the last few games, hopefully, we will continue to do the same today. <strong>One change today, Dhananjaya De Silva is not playing today, and Hemantha is playing</strong>.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain:</strong></span> &quot;We would have batted first, good pitch to bat on. Obviously, some assistance to start with but under lights there will be good assistance for our pacers. It&#39;s important for us to not get carried away by the performances we put in. <strong>No changes and same team</strong> as the last game.&quot;</p>\n",

In the 2nd innings, India&#39;s seamers took off from where they left off, breathing fire and picking up 6 wickets inside the Powerplay, helping India bundle out Sri Lanka for 55. The innings was highlighted by Shami&#39;s second 5-wicket haul this tournament <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />, also becoming <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India&#39;s leading wicket-taker in ODI World Cup history</strong></span> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/fire.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> in the process.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>Kusal Mendis, Sri Lanka Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;I am very disappointed with the team&#39;s performance and with myself also. They bowled really well, a little bit of seam movement under lights as well. Madushanka bowled really well and our bowlers did well in the middle overs. They bowled really well in the first 6 overs, and I think they deserve all the credit tonight. We have another 2 games and I hope we come back strong in the next game.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;Very happy knowing that we have officially qualified now, been a good effort from the squad when we started off in Chennai. The way we approached these 7 games, it was quite clinical, everyone put in the effort and a lot of individuals have put their hand up. It was a good challenge to put runs on the board, and that&#39;s the kind of template you gotta have when you want to score that many runs. 350 on any pitch is a very good score and a lot of credit goes to the batting unit for taking us to that score. Shreyas Iyer is a very strong lad and today he did what he is known for and that is what we expect from him. Siraj has got a lot of skills when he is operating with the new ball. To put in a performance back-to-back shows the quality of the seamers and if there is something in the conditions, they are quite lethal. All in all, it was pleasing to watch and I hope they continue to do it that way.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammad Shami is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammad Shami:</strong></span> &quot;Our bowling is in good shape and with the kind of rhythm that we are in, everyone is enjoying and everyone is happy for each other&#39;s success. I always focus on hitting the good areas and length. It&#39;s very important to be in rhythm in white ball cricket and hit the good areas. The kind of support we get from the crowd, I want to thank each and every one of them.&quot;</p>\n",

A mouthwatering contest awaits us today as it is not only the clash between the top two teams in the points table but also the <strong>top 2 teams with the highest Win % in ODI&#39;s this year</strong>. The Men in Blue will look to continue their unbeaten streak this World Cup, and a win tonight will confirm their place at the top of the table. Today also marks <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>King Kohli&#39;s 35th birthday</strong></span>, and he will look to make this day even more special with a win. In other news, <strong>Prasidh Krishna has been roped into the Indian squad after the unavailability of Hardik Pandya.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\nIn 5 World Cup games between the two sides, India have won 2 and South Africa have won 3. However, both of India&#39;s victories have come in the last two meetings between the sides at the World Cup.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the two games in this tournament so far, the first innings totals were 229 and 204. The Seamers have taken 21 wickets with an average of 19.33 and an economy rate of 4.3 in these two games whereas Spinners have picked up 10 wickets at an average of 36.30 and an economy of 4.81.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong><br />\n<strong>Ravi Shastri and Irfan Pathan:</strong> &quot;It looks like a better surface when compared to the last game played here. It did turn a bit but it got better under dew. This pitch has a lot of spots at one end, but not a lot from the other end. It does look slow, there will not be a lot of bounce, and the batters need to adjust to this surface. It has got a nice tan and there is some grass on the surface.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma has called it right at the toss and India has opted to bat first!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Captain: </strong></span>&quot;We will bat first. It&#39;ll be a good game, two teams who have played consistent cricket and have topped the table, will be nice to win and go on top. <strong>We&#39;re playing the same team</strong>, don&#39;t think we need to change anything with the way we&#39;ve been playing.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Temba Bavuma, South Africa Captain:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> </span>&quot;We would have batted first too, but now we need to chase, and will be a nice challenge.

We had had our conversations with our batters. They got 90 in the first 10 overs and we did well after that, curbed down the run-rate. We were not able to adapt unfortunately. Potentially, we might play again here in the semis.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;If you look at how we have played in the last three games, we have adapted better. We let our instincts take over, we don&#39;t preplan anything, we just assess and play accordingly. Jadeja has been very good for us playing in every format over the years. Today was a classical case as to what Jadeja is for us, came out at the death and scored vital runs, and then picked up wickets. Not to get too ahead of ourselves has been the talk in the dressing room, a couple of big games coming up and we don&#39;t want to change anything.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli:</strong></span> &quot;It was a big game, probably playing the toughest team in the tournament. There was a motivation to do well. Because it happened on my birthday, it became special and the people made it more special for me. As the ball got older, the conditions slowed down drastically. The message was clear, to keep batting around me. I&rsquo;m enjoying myself, playing cricket all over again, which is more important to me than phases. I&rsquo;m just happy that God has blessed me with that enjoyment. It&rsquo;s a very emotional moment for me, I know where I come from, I know the days I have watched Sachin Tendulkar on TV, and just to get that appreciation from him means a lot to me.&quot;</p>\n",

The table toppers India are the only unbeaten team in the tournament and are keen on finishing the league stage with a winning streak. As we play here in this iconic stadium, we are waiting to witness the King&#39;s 50th ODI Century in his own den.

Today&#39;s pitch looks very beautiful. There is a little bit of surface cracking in the wicket. We have seen some big scores here. You can take a little bit of time at the beginning of your innings.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#3498db\"><strong>ROHIT CALLS IT RIGHT &amp; INDIA WILL BAT FIRST!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#3498db\"><strong>Rohit Sharma(Indian Captain): &quot;We are going to bat. No particular reason. Whether we have batted first or bowled first, we have done really well in all the departments. Another opportunity to play better today and check all the boxes. Hats off to the guys who have stood up the most needed times and taken responsibility. We are playing the same team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Scott Edwards(Netherlands Captain): &quot;We would have batted in this wicket as well. Looks like a very good wicket, but good place for chasing. We&#39;ve had two wins. Looking to give a good performance today, give ourselves a chance. This is going to be the biggest crowd we have had this World Cup. India has been at their best, we have to be at our best. Same XI for us.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

After winning the toss, India decided to bat first. Indian batters got off to a huge start, The top 5 fired up and all the top 5 batters scored 50+ Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul scored 128 and 102 respectively and India went on to score a Huge total of 410 Runs. With the Big total on board Indians came into attack in the second innings, the dutch played really well in the powerplay by putting 62 runs with the loss of 1 wicket. The 2nd Wicket partnership involved scored 50 runs. But later on, Jadeja and Kuldeep came in and took some quick wickets led to the fall of the Netherlands Innings! Teja Nidamanuru scored half century with 6 sixes to his account. Both King Kohli and Hitman Rohit took 1 wicket each and the Indian bowling attack had a very good performance today.

We will meet on the other side in the Semifinals!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer &nbsp;Player of the Match: &quot;I had a deja vu. This has happened against Australia too, and I threw away my wicket and but I need to come not out this time. Wanted to grab some pills for my cramps. The scores I had in my back helped me. The wicket was a little two-paced. &nbsp;I have worked a lot on these shots, especially while batting nets. I was trying to hit it straight. Get into a good position and after that, it is just my followthrough!&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma (India captain): &quot;Since we started the World Cup, it was all about one game at a moment. It is a big tournament, 11 games in total It was important to break it down into single ones and focus on each one of them. We were playing in different venues and wanted to play accordingly and that&#39;s what we did in every game. Very happy at how we have played in these nine games. Everyone took responsibility. We adapted really well in all the venues. We started the World Cup four games in a row chasing, and then we had to defend and the pacers did a very good job along with the spinners. The results will keep the dressing room lively. We are playing in India, there will be a lot of expectations. We have to enjoy each other&#39;s company.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#e67e22\">Scott Edwards (Netherlands Captain): &quot;It&#39;s a tricky situation where we want to be. We&#39;re confident with our style. The tournament was always going to be tough. India is a top side. We need to improve for the T20 World Cup next year. They showed class with the bat. Learning from that.Our team is relatively young, with many emerging talents in the setup. We have upcoming training camps to sharpen our skills. As for the fixtures, we&#39;re still in the process of finalizing them.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

The stage is set here in Mumbai, with perfect weather conditions complementing a pitch that promises plenty of runs and some exciting pace bowling from the pace trio. India, riding high on an undefeated streak and led by the charismatic Rohit Sharma, looks poised to continue their dream run, boasting a formidable lineup with the likes of a rejuvenated Bumrah. Meanwhile, New Zealand, known for their adaptability and resilience, bring to the field their own brand of cricketing intellect, with key players like Ravindra and Boult ready to challenge the hosts. Buckle up, as we&#39;re all set for a cricketing spectacle that&#39;s bound to be etched in the World Cup history!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD IN World Cup:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND -</span></strong> 4<br />\n<strong>NZ&nbsp; -</strong> 5</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>WANKHEDE STADIUM, MUMBAI</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>AVERAGE 1ST INNINGS SCORE: </strong>323<br />\n<strong>HIGHEST SCORE CHASED: </strong>293<br />\n<strong>WICKET SPLIT&nbsp;<br />\nPACE: </strong>80.82%<br />\n<strong>SPIN:</strong>19.18%</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ravi Shastri:</strong> &quot;There are some patches on spinners spots. The spinners will come into play As the game takes off, later on, if there is any dew, it will play well. There will be some carry for the wicketkeeper from the hard length for seamers.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>INDIA WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO BAT!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma (India Captain): &quot;Seems like a solid wicket, leaning towards the slower side. Our last semi-final against NZ was back in 2019. They&#39;ve consistently been a strong team, promising a competitive match. Today&#39;s significance is clear...it&#39;s all about performing on the day itself.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kane Williamson (New Zealand Captain): &quot;We&#39;d have chosen to bat first too. It&#39;s a used pitch, and we&#39;re expecting some dew later on. Excited for the upcoming challenge. Anticipating a great match. Both sides have adapted to diverse conditions, and it&#39;s essentially knockout cricket now.&quot;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

India after winning the toss and choosing to bat first. This exceptional performance was anchored by Virat Kohli&#39;s landmark achievement of scoring his 50th ODI century, amassing 117 runs off 113 balls, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar&#39;s record. Shreyas Iyer, playing at his home ground, complemented Kohli&#39;s historic innings with a brilliant 105 off 70 balls. KL Rahul&#39;s swift 39 off 20 balls further bolstered India&#39;s formidable total. New Zealand&#39;s reply, though valiant, was restricted to 327, despite a solid partnership between Daryl Mitchell who scored 134 runs, and Kane Williamson, who scored 69 runs. India&#39;s bowling was dominated by Mohammed Shami&#39;s exceptional 7-wicket haul, rendering him the chief architect of New Zealand&#39;s collapse. Ravindra Jadeja&#39;s fielding was noteworthy as well, with three crucial catches contributing to India&#39;s defensive strategy. The comprehensive victory in this critical semi-final has now propelled India into the finals of the World Cup, where they will face the winner of the upcoming semi-final between The Proteas and The Aussies. This match not only highlighted India&#39;s batting depth and bowling prowess but also underscored their readiness to compete for the ultimate prize in the tournament. The anticipation for the finals is now at an all-time high, with India emerging as a formidable contender for the World Cup title.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Kane Williamson(New Zealand Captain): &quot;Firstly, congrats to India, they played outstandingly good 400 was going to be tough. but credit to the guys, a proud effort to stay in the fight till the end. Disappointing to go out of the tournament. You come in and get 400, it&#39;s a check in the box. They deserve to be here. The crowd was fantastic, unbelievable atmosphere, but special to be part of the World Cup, great to be hosted by India. We had some super contributions, Rachin and Mitchell were super special throughout the World Cup, on different surfaces. They played exceptionally well. Bowlers gave in, a lot of fight. Even if it did not go our way, &nbsp;moving forward as a team, we have taken some really good steps in the right direction.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammed Shami(Man of the Match): &quot;I was waiting for my opportunities. I did not play a lot of ODI Cricket. My return started against Kiwis in Dharamsala. I still believe in pitching it up and getting wickets with the new ball moving. I have dropped Williamson&#39;s catch, I shouldn&#39;t have done it. I felt terrible about that. But the focus was to vary the pace and see if they were hitting it in the air. The wicket was very good to bat, lots of runs were scored. It felt amazing after these kinds of performances. Last couple of World Cups, we lost in the semis. So, we wanted to do everything for this, this is the only chance we didn&#39;t want to let go of this.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma (India Captain): We all have played a lot of cricket here, it&#39;s not over until the final ball. We knew we would be tested. Our plan is to stay calm and execute the plan, we had some unfortunate moments in the field but we backed each other and always tried to get back on track. Williamson and Mitchell played a crucial knock. The energy went down a bit but we stuck to the plan and knew that we needed to break the partnership. Shami shifted the momentum and stepped up when mattered the most. Happy to see what our batters are capable of during these kinds of situations. Gill &amp; Iyer with a crucial knock of 80 and 105 and Kohli added another feather to his cap. Semifinal adds a bit of extra pressure, we just wanted to repeat what we have done throughout the tournament.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

Australia&#39;s bowlers, led by Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, showcased their prowess, putting up a disciplined performance to restrict India. The Indian innings featured notable contributions from Rahul, Rohit, and Virat Kohli, who scored a crucial fifty. Chasing the target, Australia encountered a masterclass from Travis Head, who played a sensational knock of 137 runs. Head&#39;s innings, characterized by 15 boundaries and 4 sixes, proved to be the turning point, earning him the well-deserved Player of the Match award. Despite India&#39;s spirited efforts, the Australian middle-order, featuring Marnus Labuschagne, played sensible cricket to secure the victory with seven overs to spare. While Australia celebrated their triumph, the final showcased the resilience of the Indian team, providing cricket fans with a riveting encounter between two cricketing powerhouses. The clash added another memorable chapter to the historic rivalry between India and Australia, leaving fans eagerly anticipating future battles on the cricket field.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Travis Head (Man of the Match):&quot; What an amazing day it is! Just super thrilled to be a part of this team. It&#39;s a lot better than seeing the World Cup from home. I was a little bit nervous initially but Marnus played exceptionally well and took up all the pressure. I feel the way Marsh took the game on setting the tone and that was the energy we needed. It was a great option to bowl first and the pitch got better as the game progressed. Again, it is something that I work hard on, and nice to hold on and give it all in front of a full house crowd. &quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>VIRAT KOHLI <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/crown.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> IS THE MAN OF THE TOURNAMENT <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/100.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />.&nbsp; 765 RUNS IN 11 INNINGS&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/explosion.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma (India Captain): &quot;I mean the result has not gone our way and we know that we are not 100% today. But proud of this bunch. Honestly, 20-30 runs would have been effective. I thought when Rahul and Virat were batting, we were looking at the score of 270-280 at that point and wickets fell in continuous intervals. Australia had a huge partnership after losing three wickets initially. With 240 on the scorecard, we wanted initial wickets but huge credit to Head and Labuschagne. The wicket got better to bat under the lights. &nbsp;We knew under lights, it&#39;d be better but do not want to give that as an excuse. Credit to Australian batters for that 3rd wicket partnership.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Pat Cummins (Australia Captain): &quot;I think we saved our best for the final. We have been defending the totals in the whole tournament and we thought it was a great night to chase the target. Magnificent. Marnus has a cool head and Head does what he does on the huge stage, Head shows a lot of character in him. I was pretty happy throughout the bowling. If you look around it is a special moment. You have to go out there and win the World Cup, you cannot wait for this to happen.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Although the sides would miss a number of players who participated in the finals and the format is also not the same, but as they say this part of the World can never get enough Cricket and one can definitely expect a sellout at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam. The Men in Blue has a new leader in Suryakumar Yadav who will steer a young contingent in the absence of Hardik Pandya. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ishan Kishan, and Ruturaj Gaikwad make the top order look explosive while Sky, Rinku Singh, and Jitesh Sharma are more than formidable on any given day. Axar Patel and Ravi Bishnoi will be in charge of the Spin attack while Arshdeep Singh and Prasidh Krishna minding the pace department. The Side looks inexperienced but is eager to get out there and express themselves against a very strong Australian unit that has retained quite a few of the players from the World Cup Campaign. Some big names in the Matthew Wade-led Aussie side include Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Steven Smith, and the man of the finals Travis Head. It will be a sheer test of Character for the more than capable Indian Stars going up against a resourceful Australian Unit which is a serious threat in any conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Head to Head: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India</span></strong>&nbsp;and<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&nbsp; Australia</strong></span>&nbsp;have faced each other <strong>25 times in T20Is</strong> out of which<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong> India has won 15</strong></span> while Australia has been victorious on 10 occasions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report: It seems like a good hard wicket, super flat and good to bat on, there is a good sheen and the ball will come onto the bat nicely. 180 can prove to be a winning score on this track.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS</strong>:<br />\n<strong>INDIA WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav (India Captain)&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/india.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />: &quot;We will bowl first.

Australia, batting first, set a formidable target of 208, thanks to a spectacular century (110 off 50 balls) from Josh Inglis and a solid half-century from Steven Smith. Their innings were characterized by aggressive batting and strategic partnerships. India&#39;s response was led by a magnificent knock from Suryakumar Yadav, who scored 80 off 42 balls. His innings, filled with innovative shots and fierce hitting, earned him the Man of the Match title. Ishan Kishan also contributed significantly with 58 runs. The match came down to the wire, with India reaching the target of 209/8 in 20 overs. The last over was particularly dramatic, featuring three run-outs in three consecutive balls, adding to the match&#39;s intensity. Rinku Singh&#39;s late efforts were crucial in keeping India&#39;s chase alive. Despite some economical bowling from Australia, India&#39;s relentless batting ensured a victory in this high-scoring game.

The ground isn&#39;t big, and I knew batting would get easier. Our bowlers did really well to keep them to this total. In situations like these, I just tell myself and others like Ishan to enjoy. The atmosphere was amazing, thanks to the crowd. It was great to see how Rinku kept calm in a tailor-made situation for him. Our bowlers&#39; performance after the 16th over was an incredible achievement.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

India are leading the series with two victories in two games. Both the matches were high scoring ones and India won one batting first and one bowling first. What will India do if they win the toss? Each match has seen new heros. Who will be today&#39;s heros? Wait for the action!!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>AUSTRALIA CALLS RIGHT AT THE TOSS AND THEY ELECT TO FIELD FIRST!!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Matthew Wade, Australian Skipper: &quot;We opt to bowl first. Dew should settle in early so I don&#39;t think it matters a lot. But it&#39;s quite wet already and could only become more wet. We were short in a couple of phases, but the boys are in good shape. Travis Head, Kane Richardson and Jason Behrendorff comes in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav, Indian Skipper: &quot;We are happy to bat first.

The match, saw Glenn Maxwell&#39;s electrifying century (104* off 48) steer Australia to a successful chase of India&#39;s formidable 222/3. Maxwell&#39;s heroics in the final over, needing 21 runs, epitomized his aggressive batting throughout the innings, especially crucial after early wickets had left Australia reeling. Earlier, Ruturaj Gaikwad&#39;s masterful unbeaten 123 from 57 balls was the backbone of India&#39;s innings. His knock, laden with 13 fours and 7 sixes, showcased exceptional batting finesse, propelling India to a daunting total despite losing partners like Suryakumar Yadav (39 off 29) and Ishan Kishan early. The Indian bowling attack, led by Ravi Bishnoi (2/32), initially seemed in control, especially after dismissing key players like Marcus Stoinis and Tim David. However, Maxwell&#39;s late onslaught, coupled with the dew factor, tilted the scales in Australia&#39;s favor. Australia&#39;s thrilling victory in the 3rd T20I has kept them very much alive in the five-match series against India.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav, India captain: &quot;The plan was to get Maxwell out as quickly as possible. Australia were always in the game. Axar is an experienced bowler, thought there&rsquo;s always a chance for an experienced bowler even if it&rsquo;s a spinner when there&rsquo;s dew, that is the reason to give him th 19th over. Very proud of my boys.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Matthew Wade, Australia captain: &quot;You dont get much better than that. Injury to Kane Richardson made me to bowl Maxi in the last over. He played brilliantly, got a 100 in his 100th T20I. Thought we were in the game at 190 after the 19th over but the last over went for thirty. All in good fun in the end. The boys are in good spirits, hopefully we can pinch another one in the next game and take it down to the last game.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#e67e22\">Glenn Maxwell is the Player of the Match</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#e67e22\">Glenn Maxwell: &quot;It all went pretty quickly. It was hard for them to bowl yorkers with so much dew. We didn&rsquo;t really have a number in mind. Knew we would be in the game if we could take it down to the final over. Wade was brilliant out there.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>In the upcoming 4th T20I at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium in Raipur, India, positioned with a 2-1 lead in the series, is eyeing a series win against Australia. The Aussies, revitalized by their recent victory, look to level the series. Notably, Glenn Maxwell, Australia&#39;s standout performer, will be absent from this match. India might introduce Deepak Chahar and Mukesh Kumar for their swing bowling prowess, while Shreyas Iyer is likely to return to the batting lineup. The pitch in Raipur, known for its balanced nature favoring pacers, sets the stage for a strategic contest. With an average first innings score of 147, the toss could play a pivotal role. The historical edge lies with India, who has won 17 of their 29 T20I encounters against Australia. This match presents an opportunity for both teams to fine-tune strategies and player roles in preparation for upcoming global T20 contests.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Pitch Report:<br />\nMurali Kartik and Matthew Hayden:</strong> &quot;The wicket looks good, well rolled, hard and has a nice grass coverage. It&#39;s uniform 74m all around the ground. Dew should be a factor and the captain winning the toss would choose to bowl first.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>MATTHEW WADE CALLS RIGHT AT THE TOSS AND AUSTRALIA WILL BOWL FIRST!!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Matthew Wade, Australian Skipper: &quot;We will bowl here.

Everyone gets an exciting opportunity.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav, Indian Skipper: &quot;We would have bowled as well. But our batting unit has been firing well. First T20I here, let&#39;s see how it goes, very excited. We also have changes for us as Mukesh comes in for Prasidh, Deepak Chahar comes in for Arshdeep, Shreyas replaces Tilak and there is one more change.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Australia won the toss and opted to field first with dew being considered a factor. Jaiswal and R Gaikwad provided a platform by scoring (37 off 28) and (32 off 28) after which India lost their vice-skipper and skipper early. Rinku Singh (46 off 29) and Jitesh Sharma (35 off 19) in the middle put up 56 run partnership which led the team to post a total of 174 runs. In the second innings, Travis Head opened the innings powerfully scoring 31 off 16 but as soon as the spinners stepped in, they kept on taking wickets and put the opposition under pressure. Then wickets fell one by one! M Wade (36* off 23) fired but couldn&#39;t finish the game well. Axar Patel was the highest wicket-taker with three wickets.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Matthew Wade, Australian skipper: &quot;We did not play spin well. We lost a few wickets in the middle as well. The guys came in and did a good job with the ball but unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t bat well. We just want to continue to learn from the guys who are already established in the team. To have depth in the squad is really key as the T20 World Cup is around the corner.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav, Indian Skipper: &quot;Everything went well other than the toss. The Boys showed character and that was most important for us. We spoke in the meeting before the game to go out and express and be fearless. Axar under bowled superbly. The plan was to go for the Yorkers and then see what happens.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Axar Patel is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Axar Patel: &quot;I was trying a lot of things and it came out well today. I stuck to my strengths. To stay attacking and be mentally strong is important. During the break, I focussed on improving myself and adding new variations to my bowling.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>In the final showdown of the India-Australia T20I series at Bengaluru&#39;s M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, India, already having won the series, leading 3-1, will seek to conclude the series on a high note. This 5th T20I is more than a mere formality; it&#39;s a crucial juncture for Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s team to refine their strategies ahead of their tour to South Africa. This is where the road to T20 World Cup 2024 begins. Conversely, Australia will aim for a consolation victory to end the series positively.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, India holds a significant advantage over Australia in T20 Internationals, with a 60% win rate in 30 games. This match presents a strategic battleground, testing India&#39;s depth and versatility against Australia&#39;s determination and skill.</p>\n\n<p>The batsman-friendly pitch at Bengaluru, typically offering a flat surface conducive to high scores, sets the stage for an expected run feast. This finale is more than a contest of cricketing skills; it&#39;s a testament to T20 cricket&#39;s dynamic nature, where adaptability, strategy, and individual brilliance converge. Key players from both teams are under the spotlight, carrying the expectations of delivering impactful performances that set the tone for their upcoming international fixtures.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 30 games,<strong> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India - 18.</span> <span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Australia - 11.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS (2023):</strong></p>\n\n<p>AVERAGE 1st INNINGS SCORE: 196/6</p>\n\n<p>AVERAGE 1st INNINGS WINNING SCORE: 198/7</p>\n\n<p>HIGHEST SCORE SUCCESSFULLY CHASED: 212</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:<br />\nDeep Dasgupta and Matthew Hayden:</strong>&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s a high scoring venue. It has one of the quick outfield. It is very quick and it isn&#39;t big. The Square boundaries are 66 and 65 metres, the straight one is 76 metres. It&#39;s a very good wicket to bat on. On a fullish length, it&#39;s quite dry and it tends to turn a bit. Maybe it can behave inconsistent with both pace and bounce. Don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be dew factor involved in this game. India will look to bat first, put the middle order of Australians under pressure with a scoreboard pressure because of the nature of the pitch.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>MATTHEW WADE CALLS RIGHT AT THE TOSS AND AUSTRALIA WILL BOWL FIRST!!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Matthew Wade, Australian Skipper: &quot;There&#39;s some rain in the air, and the wicket seems tacky, which is why we chose to field first. Nathan Ellis is coming in for Green. It&#39;s a great opportunity for our young players to step up, especially since a lot of the World Cup players have gone home. It&#39;s an exciting time, and we&#39;re looking forward to having some stability in the team.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav, Indian Skipper: &quot;We would have loved to bowl first. I&#39;ve told the team to not change anything. It&#39;s another opportunity to play in front of an amazing crowd, so the message is just to go and enjoy. For the batting unit, I&#39;ve emphasized believing and executing.

India set a competitive total, bolstered by significant contributions from their batting lineup. The match reached a dramatic climax in the final over, with India&#39;s Harshadeep Singh displaying exceptional skill and nerve to defend 10 runs. His performance under immense pressure was crucial in clinching India&#39;s victory. The series concluded with India showcasing their depth and talent , winning the series 4-1.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Matthew Wade(Australia Captain) - &quot;I think we bowled quite well overall. It&#39;s disappointing, though, how we performed with the bat in the last five or six overs. There&#39;s always this temptation to move up the order, particularly against the spinners. My role is to steer the team through situations like we faced tonight. We&#39;ve played some solid cricket in this series. McDermott, for instance, has really bounced back. It&#39;s tough playing in conditions like these.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Axar Patel (Player of the Match)-&quot;Today&#39;s match was really enjoyable for me. Unlike the first four matches where there was dew, today&#39;s wicket was just perfect for my style. It took a couple of games, but I&#39;ve found my rhythm now. Bowling alongside Ravi Bishnoi, who I&#39;ve played with in Gujarat, works well for us. We complement each other&#39;s styles, and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how our partnership develops.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ravi Bishnoi (Player of the Series)-&quot;In the first match, I didn&#39;t bowl, so I just concentrated on executing my plans effectively. My approach is straightforward - to bowl stump-to-stump. Regarding the upcoming South Africa series, it&#39;s a different wicket and a different challenge, but I&#39;ll try to adapt as quickly as possible.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav(India Captain) - &quot;Yeah, it was a great series from the start. We definitely aimed to be fearless and enjoy our time in the middle, so I&#39;m really happy with how that turned out. Having watched numerous games at Chinnaswamy, I know that a total in the range of 160-175 can be quite tricky to chase here.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES ABOUT THE 2ND T20I!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As the men in blue gear up to face South Africa in today&#39;s 1st T20I clash, the anticipation is palpable. Fresh off a commanding series win over Australia, the Indian team, now under Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s leadership, is brimming with confidence. The series against South Africa offers a new challenge and an opportunity for India to test their mettle against a formidable opponent in tough South African conditions. The match, set to take place at Kingsmead in Durban, promises a thrilling contest. The conditions at Durban, often influenced by the coastal weather, might play a crucial role in the game&#39;s dynamics. Reports tell us that it has been raining in Durban. For India, this series is not just about continuing their winning momentum but also about fine-tuning their squad composition and strategy ahead of more significant challenges like the 2024 T20 World Cup. The focus will be on young talents stepping up and seasoned players providing stability. South Africa will look to leverage their home advantage and counter India&#39;s strengths. As the teams prepare for the clash, the cricketing world eagerly awaits to see how the strategies unfold and which players rise to the occasion in this exciting T20 matchup.</p>\n",

        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>South Africa chose to field first after winning the toss, considering the forecast of rain during the game. India faced early setbacks, losing both openers for zero runs. Tilak Varma, batting third, managed 29 runs from 20 balls. Then, a critical 70-run stand between Captain Suryakumar Yadav, who scored 56 off 36, and Rinku Singh, with an unbeaten 68 off 39, propelled India to 180/7 in 19.3 overs. However, rain caused a disruption, leading to a revised target of 152 runs in 15 overs for South Africa. In their innings, Reeza Hendricks scored 49 runs, and Aiden Markram added 30, bringing the team close to the target. T Stubbs and A Phehlukwayo successfully clinched the match for South Africa, with 7 balls to spare.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav, Indian skipper: &quot;Their exceptional batting initially shifted the game in their favor. It reflects the style of cricket, we want to play freely and express ourselves. Handling the wet ball was challenging, but such scenarios are likely to recur, providing us with valuable learning opportunities.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Tabraiz Shamsi is the player of the match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Tabraiz Shamsi: &quot;Performing well under pressure against India feels rewarding. Aiden&#39;s strategic alterations were outstanding. Ever since Rob joined, he&#39;s fostered a great team atmosphere. This approach is clearly reflected in our on-field performance.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Aiden Markram, South Africa Captain: &quot;We had a fantastic crowd today, and it was great to perform well in their presence. The pitch was a bit slow initially, but it picked up pace after the rain. If a particular matchup is effective, we stick with it. Reeza Hendricks has been outstanding. I&#39;m really pleased for him. With the World Cup approaching, we&#39;re focusing on players in form. This healthy competition is very important to us.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Welcome to the live coverage of the first ODI of India vs South Africa, set to unfold at The Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. This series opener is not just a game; it&#39;s a narrative of rising talents and strategic prowess. KL Rahul, leading India, brings a youthful yet experienced side. This presents an opportunity for emerging stars like Ruturaj Gaikwad and Sai Sudharsan to shine. South Africa, captained by Aiden Markram, boasts a formidable lineup with the likes of David Miller and Rassie van der Dussen. The addition of uncapped Nandre Burger adds an element of surprise to their bowling attack. The pitch at &quot;Bull Ring&quot;, typically favorable for batting, might offer some assistance to bowlers due to recent rainfall, adding a twist to the tale. Reflecting on their last encounter at the World Cup 2023, both teams are well aware of the high stakes. Key battles to watch include India&#39;s young batsmen against South Africa&#39;s pace attack and the duel between Indian spinners and the Proteas&#39; middle order.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head-to-Head</strong>&nbsp;<br />\nIn ODIs, India and South Africa have faced each other 91 times. South Africa holds an advantage with 50 wins, while India has won 38 matches. Three matches ended with no result.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Venue Stats (ODIs)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Average 1st Innings Score</strong>: 241<br />\n<strong>Highest Total</strong>: 439<br />\n<strong>Bat First Wins</strong>: 23<br />\n<strong>Bat Second Wins</strong>: 30&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pommie Mbangwa</strong>: &quot;We&#39;re playing on a pitch that was last used a few days ago. The dimensions are notable - 77 meters straight down the ground, with the square boundaries at 59 and 69 meters. It&#39;s a dry surface, typical of a used pitch. Given these conditions, the team winning the toss would likely opt to bat first, aiming to stack up the runs early. There are a few cracks on the surface, but they haven&#39;t opened up significantly. The grass present is primarily to keep the pitch intact. On this ground, 270 runs is the average score, but in the last five ODIs, it&#39;s been around 298. Teams will want to aim higher than that, avoiding falling below these figures. The strategy should be to bat first and aim for a high total.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>South Africa Won the toss and elected to bat first&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Aiden Markram | South Africa Captain: &quot;I&#39;m opting to bat first, considering the wicket has been used before. &quot;It&#39;s a fantastic day, notably the pink day, and I&#39;m hopeful that both teams will deliver a memorable performance. We&#39;re introducing a debutant today - Nandre Burger. It&#39;s thrilling to offer opportunities to some talented players; they must seize these moments and stake their claims.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul | India Captain: &quot;It&#39;s the Pink ODI, a standout event in South Africa I&#39;ve always admired. Eager for today&#39;s gripping game. The pitch is spin-friendly and ideal for tactical play. Excited for Sai Sudharsan&#39;s debut. Our team boasts IPL-experienced players like Ruturaj, the exciting Tilak, and Sanju. Spinners Axar and Kuldeep are ready to shine. These players, seasoned in high-pressure situations, bring invaluable IPL experience. I&#39;m optimistic for top-notch performances today.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

In only his second ODI, Sai Sudharsan impressively notched up back-to-back fifties, even after losing his partner Ruturaj early on. The captain, batting at number four, played a pivotal innings of 56 off 64 balls, propelling the team&#39;s total past the 200 mark. Nandre Burger emerged as the top bowler of the innings, claiming three wickets. The second innings saw a solid opening stand of 130 runs. Tony De Zorzi achieved his first-ever century, and significant contributions from R Hendricks (52 off 81) and R Van Der Dussen (36 off 51) enabled the team to comfortably reach the target with 7 overs to spare.</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, Indian Skipper: &quot;Winning the toss might have been advantageous, considering the pitch assistance in the first half. It was a tough pitch, but Sai and I were well-settled. A big century from either of us could have added 50-60 more runs, a key takeaway for future games. A target around 240 would have been ideal, but unfortunately, we lost wickets at crucial times while the pitch continued to offer help. Missing out on a catch was a setback. We aim to leave what happens in the game behind and concentrate on the upcoming matches.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Tony De Zorzi is the player of the match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Tony De Zorzi: &quot;I&#39;m okay, just feeling a bit stiff. Honestly, it was an overwhelming mix of emotions. &nbsp;There were many doubters, and it feels great to prove them wrong. Rob and JP had a chat with me about their expectations for me as an opener. I consider myself adaptable, especially in adjusting to different conditions. It probably hasn&#39;t fully hit me yet. &nbsp;It&#39;s a moment I&#39;ll always cherish.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Aiden Markram, South African Skipper: &quot;Significantly improved from our last outing. We showed a stronger overall game. The pitch was still challenging during our chase, but our openers did a fantastic job battling through. The wind was a notable factor today. Nandre, with the wind at his back, he really fired in those deliveries. We varied our approach considerably, focusing on bowling in the right areas with excellent execution. Tony de Zorzi&#39;s performance was monumental, especially considering his limited experience. To remain not out and lead the chase is an extraordinary achievement. Today, whatever target was set, our mindset was to chase it down confidently. We&#39;re definitely a more self-assured team after this match.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

It will be an interesting clash going ahead.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>HEAD TO HEAD:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nIn an overall 93 games played between the two teams, South Africa has an edge over India with 51 wins while the Men in Blue have managed to win 39 times. Three games have not yielded results.&nbsp;<br />\nIn South Africa they have played each other 39 times with India winning 11 and losing 26 games, two games ended in no result.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>SOUTH AFRICA WON THE TOSS AND THEY ELECT TO FIELD FIRST!!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Aiden Markram, South Africa Skipper: &quot;We opt to bowl first. Looks like a good wicket, doesn&#39;t seem to change too much. We want to keep challenging ourselves. We will try to take wickets regularly and restrict them to a low total. Expect to do more of the same we did in the previous game. The dimensions here are different, so running hard between wickets will be key. We are going with the same xi.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, Indian Skipper: &quot;Not really bothered by being put to bat first. The wicket will be even for both innings. We got ourselves to a good position in the previous game but ended up losing 5 wickets for 40 odd runs. Once we get a good start, we have to make use of it. Today is another opportunity for the boys to prove themselves. This looks like a much better wicket than the previous two. Hopefully we can get plenty of runs today. We have two changes as Rajat Patidar makes his ODI debut and replaces Ruturaj. Kuldeep gets a rest and Washington Sundar comes in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Their pacers performed admirably, removing both Indian openers in the initial powerplay. However, a solid and crucial partnership of 116 runs in 136 balls between Sanju Samson and Tilak Varma (52 off 77) stabilized the innings. Sanju Samson scored an impressive 108 off 114 deliveries, marking his first ODI century. Rinku Singh&#39;s dynamic 38 off 27 helped India reach a competitive total of 296 runs. In their pursuit, R Hendricks and T De Zorzi put up an opening partnership of 59 runs. Though T De Zorzi contributed a significant 81 off 87, the standout performance was Arshdeep&#39;s remarkable four-wicket haul. India clinched the match by 78 runs and secured the series with a 2-1 victory.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Aiden Markram, South Africa Captain: &quot;We were definitely geared up for this series decider, a great venue, and a supportive crowd. Sadly, we couldn&#39;t pull through in the end. We had our moments, but we just couldn&#39;t maintain momentum in our favor consistently. The pitch remained fairly consistent throughout the match, and a target of 290 seemed achievable. We performed well with the ball. I don&#39;t believe the toss had a significant impact on the game today. Looking ahead, the Test series is thrilling, with two fantastic venues for the matches here in South Africa &ndash; it really doesn&#39;t get much better than this.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Sanju Samson is the player of the match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Sanju Samson: &quot;I&#39;m really proud of it, especially given the outcome of the match. I&#39;ve been putting in a lot of effort, not just in the past few months, so seeing the results is good. This format allows a bit more time to get a feel for the pitch and understand the bowler&#39;s strategy. Batting higher in the order gives the advantage of those extra 10-20 deliveries. The entire nation is proud of how Tilak Verma has risen to the occasion. The veterans in Indian cricket have set high benchmarks, and the younger players are stepping in and delivering.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Arshdeep Singh is the player of the series</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Arshdeep Singh: &quot;The pitch offered something all day long, with the ball occasionally gripping and halting. Our strategy was straightforward: aim for a wicket-to-wicket line to increase the chances of LBWs and bowled dismissals. We&#39;re really enjoying the opportunities we&#39;ve been given. We&#39;re eager to continue giving our best in the future and strive for success.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, Indian Skipper: &quot;I always love the time spent with the team. It&#39;s refreshing to return to cricket after a letdown at the World Cup. My usual advice is to enjoy the game, put in your best effort. These players are talented, but some are new to international cricket, so they need time to adapt. My role is to clarify their responsibilities, and they&#39;ve all given their all. Sanju has been an outstanding performer. He hasn&#39;t had many opportunities to bat higher up the order for various reasons, so it&#39;s wonderful to see him succeed today.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

India, bolstered by their ODI series win and a drawn T20 series, steps onto the field with high spirits and a formidable lineup. The inclusion of stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma adds significant strength and experience to the team. They aim to translate their white-ball success into the longer format and secure a historic series win on South African soil, a feat yet to be achieved by the side.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-to-Head:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>South Africa and India have faced each other in 42 matches, with South Africa holding a slight edge with 17 wins compared to India&#39;s 15, while 10 matches have ended in a draw. In South Africa, the teams have clashed 23 times, with the hosts winning 12 and India clinching 4 victories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Shaun Pollock and Ravi Shastri observe a healthy grass cover, suggesting teams generally prefer to bat first as the pitch initially plays slower. As the Test unfolds, varying bounce might present challenges, making batting increasingly difficult. Weather conditions may tempt South Africa to forgo a spinner, but sunshine could deepen cracks and invite spin. The pitch&#39;s character isn&#39;t expected to drastically shift throughout the game. The optimal strategy is to bat first, navigate the initial sessions cautiously, and aim to be no more than two wickets down by Lunch.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS : <span style=\"color:#27ae60\">SOUTH AFRICA WON THE TOSS AND ELECT TO BOWL&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Temba Bavuma</strong>&nbsp;: &quot;<strong>We are opting to bowl first due to the wicket&#39;s moisture from being under covers, aiming to leverage it for early breakthroughs. Most of our squad is in peak condition, though Lungi is still getting there. Today, we introduce two debutants, Nandre Burger and David Bedingham, and are going with a four-seamer attack.

Our strategy is to post a competitive total and let our bowlers take over. Despite the overhead conditions and grass, we&#39;re ready for the challenge. We&#39;ve come close in the last two tours, boosting our confidence in our squad&#39;s composition. We&#39;re playing four seamers and Ashwin as a spinner in place of Jadeja, who has a back spasm. Prasidh is making his debut today, alongside Shardul, Siraj, and Bumrah.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Welcome to live coverage of the final match between South Africa and India at Newlands, Cape Town. India is coming off a heavy defeat in the opening match, having lost by an innings and 32 runs. Despite strong individual performances by KL Rahul in the first innings and Kohli in the second, the team&#39;s overall performance left much to be desired. This loss means their aspiration to clinch a series win on South African turf is postponed. India aims to make a strong comeback and draw the series. Avesh Khan is expected to make his debut, replacing Prasidh Krishna, and Jadeja is likely to come in for Ashwin, having recovered from his spasm. South Africa enters the game buoyed by their comprehensive victory in the first match. The team will miss Bavuma due to injury, and Elgar will lead in what is his final Test. South Africa is seeking to maintain their form and secure another win.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>When it comes to head-to-head records in the 43 matches played between these two giants, South Africa has a slight edge with 18 wins compared to India&#39;s 15, while 10 matches have ended in a draw. Specifically, in South Africa, out of 24 encounters, the host country has triumphed 13 times, and India has managed 4 victories.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report :&nbsp;Sanjay Manjrekar</strong><strong>:&quot;There is grass inside the cracks, which might lead the ball to behave as it would on a barren patch. South Africa is a very unique place to bowl, and I feel that seamers will continue to get help on every day of the Test.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS : <span style=\"color:#27ae60\">South Africa won the toss and elected to bat first&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Dean Elgar : &quot;Going to bat. The pitch looks interesting. We&#39;re in a great position. Can&#39;t win a two-match series if you don&#39;t win the first - we&#39;ve crossed that hurdle. The scoreboard starts on nought. We all know that. Starting well is going to be key against this Indian side. We&#39;ve got a debutant in Tristan Stubbs coming in for Temba. Ngidi comes in for Coetzee who&#39;s also injured. And Maharaj comes in.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma : &quot;Would&#39;ve batted first as well. Looks a good pitch. We understand the challenge of batting first on that pitch, but nevertheless, there will be enough in the pitch for the seamers, so hopefully, we&#39;ll cash in on it. It&#39;s important to forget what&#39;s happened in the past. We understand the importance of getting runs on the board, and getting 20 wickets. Didn&#39;t happen in the first game, but we&#39;re upbeat about what we can achieve here. Two changes. Jadeja comes back for Ashwin. Shardul misses out, Mukesh Kumar replaces him.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The Test unfolded at a breakneck pace, becoming the shortest completed match in cricket&#39;s history, concluding in just over four sessions. Opting to bat, South Africa crumbled to 55 all out in their first innings, their lowest score post-readmission, with Mohammed Siraj delivering a career-best 6 for 15. India initially steadied the ship but then experienced a dramatic collapse, ending at 153, setting a modest lead.Day 2 was no less thrilling. Jasprit Bumrah&#39;s early strikes and a collective bowling effort kept the Proteas in check. Aiden Markram stood out with a defiant century in treacherous conditions, giving South Africa a glimmer of hope. However, his dismissal signaled a swift end to their innings, setting India a target of 79. India&#39;s top order, despite a few stumbles, chased down the total with Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer steering the ship home.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Dean Elgar Captain|Player of the Series&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>: &quot;This game was tough for us, yet I entered it feeling positive. Though I wish I could&#39;ve done more here, I&#39;m still very proud of my performance at Centurion and contributing to a win. The conditions were challenging throughout the series. It would have been great to have a 3-Test series to further challenge ourselves against top players like Bumrah, who is truly world-class and deserves recognition. I&#39;m glad I won&#39;t have to face this bowling attack again but I&#39;ll carry fond memories. We&#39;ve come a long way since I received my green cap in 2012, and I&#39;ve hardly missed a series since then. It holds a special place in my heart. As for this series, while a 2-0 win would have been ideal, managing a 1-1 draw is something I&#39;m proud of for the team. The bowlers&#39; performance and Aiden&#39;s batting in the second innings were exceptional. The pitch was deceptive, playing very differently than expected and presented a significant learning curve for us. Though India outplayed us in that crucial first session, these experiences only add to the journey, and I&#39;m grateful for every moment spent competing at this level.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jasprit Bumrah | Player of the Series: &quot;Newlands will forever hold a special place in my heart, marking the beginning of my journey and filled with fond memories. I&#39;m elated that today went well for us. It all started back in 2018 when our bowling unit was keen to make an impact. In India, it&#39;s usually the spinners taking the lead, but our team, now in transition, sees a lot of new bowlers stepping in. Our constant message is about team spirit and resilience. We showed that fight in the last game and continued it here, which requires immense patience. It&#39;s a delight to see our efforts come to fruition in this game. The pace at which the match concluded was unexpected, and like our counterparts, we too preferred batting first. Test cricket always has its surprises, making this a fantastic series.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohammed Siraj | Player of the Match: &quot;These are my best figures in my Test career. My focus was on being consistent and targeting the right areas. In the previous match, I wasn&#39;t as consistent, leading to conceding extra runs. So, I really worked hard on maintaining consistency and being relentless with my lengths. Playing alongside Bumrah, we understand each other well and quickly adapt to the pitch conditions. A big shout out to the fans &mdash; thank you so much for your constant support, please keep it coming!&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma| Captain: &quot;It&#39;s a great feat. We had a learning curve in Centurion and came back strongly here, especially our bowlers who adapted and executed our plans well. We applied ourselves with the bat to secure a significant lead, though the loss of the last six wickets wasn&#39;t ideal. We were aware it might be a short game, so every run was crucial. Siraj&#39;s performance was very special and rare. We emphasized on keeping things simple, and he, along with the pitch conditions, did the rest. Immense credit to Siraj, Bumrah, Mukesh, and Prasidh for their remarkable efforts.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India and Afghanistan are all set for an exciting three-match T20I series, commencing on 11th January at the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. This series holds significant importance for India as it&#39;s their final T20I engagement before the upcoming T20 World Cup, scheduled to be held in the USA and West Indies later this year. The Men in Blue, are coming off a mixed tour in South Africa where they clinched the ODI series but had to settle for draws in the other formats.<br />\nA major boost for the Indian squad is the return of their seasoned campaigners, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Rohit, taking over the captaincy reins, is returning to the T20 format for the first time since the T20 World Cup in 2022.<br />\nAfghanistan, on the other side, is riding high on confidence after securing a 2-1 series victory over the UAE. However, they will face a tough challenge against India, especially in the absence of their regular skipper Rashid Khan. Ibrahim Zadran will be leading the Afghan side in this crucial series. It remains to be seen how Afghanistan, known for their love of the T20 format, will fare against a strong Indian side in these matches.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India vs Afghanistan Head-to-Head:&nbsp;<br />\nBoth teams have contested on five occasions with India winning four games and one game ending in no result. Afghanistan are yet to open their account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT: Deep Dasgupta and Nick Knight - The presence of a green tinge on the grass suggests initial assistance for fast bowlers, particularly with the new ball. However, as the game progresses, the surface is expected to become more conducive to batting, allowing the ball to slide on nicely.&nbsp;Interestingly, fast bowlers have traditionally found this pitch challenging, while spinners have thrived. The unique style of Afghanistan&#39;s spinners, who tend to bowl quickly, reduces the reaction time for batters and can rush them into making decisions. This could be a key factor in the match. Lastly, they anticipate no dew impact on the game, as was the case last night, ensuring consistent playing conditions throughout.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image (37)_1704983018.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India won the toss and elected to field first.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma|India Captain: &quot;We&#39;ve decided to field first. There&#39;s no specific reason behind this choice; the pitch here at Mohali is consistent and doesn&rsquo;t vary much. These three games are crucial for us, especially since we haven&#39;t played much T20 cricket in the lead-up to the World Cup. Of course, there&#39;s the IPL, but playing in international matches is a different ball game, and we&#39;re keen to make the most of this opportunity. I&#39;ve had a discussion with Rahul Dravid about our team composition and strategy moving forward. Our focus is on understanding and executing our roles effectively as a unit. However, the ultimate goal remains to win.</strong></span>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>Ibrahim Zadran|Afghanistan Captain: &quot;We had also hoped to bowl first, but it&#39;s not a significant concern for us.

We are focusing on playing aggressive and positive cricket, which is crucial for our team&#39;s development.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The match, a spectacle of high-octane cricket, saw Afghanistan post a score of 158, falling short by 25 runs from the venue&#39;s average first-innings score. India, showcasing their batting prowess, was poised for a successful chase, despite a tumultuous start.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Afghanistan&#39;s innings, had its moments of brilliance, especially the resilient partnership between Omarzai and Nabi. However, India&#39;s disciplined bowling, interspersed with moments of brilliance, kept the Afghan score in check. The Indian bowlers, adept in their craft, applied relentless pressure, thereby restricting Afghanistan to a sub-par total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Indian innings commenced with a moment of misfortune, as captain Rohit Sharma was run out for a duck, a victim of a communication breakdown. Shubman Gill, after crafting some scintillating shots, succumbed to his aggressive tendencies, leaving India in a precarious position. The resurgence was led by the southpaw duo of Tilak Varma and Shivam Dube, who stitched together a critical 44-run partnership, tipping the scales in India&#39;s favor.&nbsp;Amidst these ebbs and flows, the unwavering Shivam Dube emerged as the cornerstone of India&#39;s chase. Demonstrating a blend of steadfastness and aggression, Dube carved out boundaries with clinical precision. His innings crescendoed to an unbeaten 60, his highest score in T20Is, marked by a majestic six that sealed the game for India. Dube&#39;s innings was not just about the runs but the manner in which he accumulated them, reflecting a maturity that augurs well for India&#39;s middle-order.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This victory for India was not just about the numbers on the scoreboard but also about the statement they made. It was a testament to their depth in batting and resilience in bouncing back from challenging situations. The series opener has set the stage for an enthralling contest, with India looking to consolidate their lead and Afghanistan aiming for redemption.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Ibrahim Zadran|Afghanistan Captain: &quot;Reflecting on our performance, I feel we were short by about 13-15 runs. Winning the toss might have made a difference, but that&#39;s part of the game. Despite this, I&#39;m proud of how the boys fought. Our initial strategy was to get a strong start in the powerplay, but losing early wickets derailed our plans. Ideally, one of us should have stayed at the crease for 14-15 overs, but the frequent loss of wickets put us under pressure, especially the new batters. Regarding our fielding, the second innings did see some challenges due to the dew, which made gripping the ball difficult. However, I must admit we were a bit lax in our fielding today. That&#39;s an area we need to improve. As for our batting, we will work on enhancing it too. I don&#39;t see any major concerns with our bowling. We&#39;ll focus on analyzing and learning from the mistakes we made in this match&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma|India Captain:&quot;I have to say it was extremely cold out there, more than I expected. My fingers are okay now, but during the match, every time the ball hit the tip of my fingers, it was quite painful. At one point, I couldn&#39;t even feel my fingers.Looking back, there were a lot of positives from the game, especially in our bowling department. The conditions weren&#39;t the easiest, but I was really impressed with how our spinners performed. About my own dismissal, it&#39;s natural to feel frustrated because you always want to contribute and score runs for the team. I was hoping for Gill to continue his good form, but unfortunately, he got out.I&#39;m really pleased with several performances &ndash; Shivam Dube&#39;s batting was a highlight, and the way Jitesh, Tilak, and Rinku played was also commendable. Looking ahead to the next game, we want to experiment a bit, try some new strategies with our bowlers, like how Washington Sundar bowled the 19th over today. We&#39;re open to trying different things, but not at the expense of winning the match.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;Shivam Dube|Player of the Match Talking about the game:&quot; I have to admit it was really cold, but playing on this ground was still an enjoyable experience for me, especially since it&#39;s been a long time since I last played. Batting at No. 4 did bring some pressure, but I was determined to stick to my style of cricket. Usually, in the initial few balls, there&#39;s a bit of pressure, but once I get past that, I focus solely on the ball and avoid overthinking. I&#39;m confident in my ability to hit big sixes in T20s, so I always feel like I can score runs in any situation.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

As the series unfolds, India, buoyed by their initial triumph in Mohali, leads 1-0, poised to further their dominance in this series. Tonight, all eyes are on the Indian camp, particularly on the charismatic Virat Kohli, returning to fortify India&#39;s batting fortress after a hiatus from the T20I scene. His presence injects not just skill but a fervor that is unmistakably Kohli-esque. The Indian squad, under the astute captaincy of Rohit Sharma, is brimming with the intent to wrap up the series with another compelling victory.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s opening win, while decisive, highlighted areas ripe for refinement. The bowling strategy, particularly the spin department&#39;s role, and the batting lineup&#39;s consistency remain in focus.

There&#39;s no specific reason for this choice, other than the nature of this ground and its relatively small boundaries. In our team meeting, we discussed our strategies, and I&#39;m glad to see how well we executed them in the first game. We&#39;ve assigned specific roles to our players, and I&#39;m proud to say they&#39;ve lived up to them. Our approach is to support our team members, ensuring they feel free and unburdened on the field. While we are keeping the upcoming World Cup in mind, we understand that achieving good results in these matches is also crucial. For this game, we&#39;re bringing in Virat Kohli and Yashasvi Jaiswal, replacing Gill and Tilak.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&nbsp;Ibrahim Zadran|Afghanistan Captain&quot;We&#39;re focusing on improving our batting performance today. Despite not winning the toss and being asked to bat first, which wasn&#39;t our initial preference, we&#39;re determined to put up a strong total. We&#39;ve had discussions about our previous game&#39;s shortcomings and worked hard in the nets to address them. Our start in the last match wasn&#39;t ideal, but we&#39;ve talked it over and are hopeful for a better beginning this time around. Unfortunately, Rahmat won&#39;t be playing today, but we&#39;re bringing in Noor Ahmad for this match.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Despite an early setback with Rohit Sharma&#39;s departure without scoring, the Indian team demonstrated remarkable composure in their chase. Virat Kohli, known for his classical approach, surprised with an unusually aggressive strategy, launching into powerful slogs that contributed to a rapid 29 runs before he was dismissed by Naveen-ul-Haq.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Yashasvi Jaiswal, maintained a steady yet dynamic presence at the crease. His approach was defined by constantly seeking out aggressive scoring opportunities, especially against spinners. This approach paid off handsomely, as he raced to a fifty in just 27 balls.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Shivam Dube&#39;s innings was a spectacle in itself. Facing a seasoned bowler like Mohammad Nabi, Dube unleashed a barrage of sixes, displaying his prowess against spin. His explosive batting, characterized by a quickfire 22-ball fifty, played a pivotal role in guiding India towards the finish line. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>While Karim Janat&#39;s bowling did introduce a brief period of resistance by claiming two wickets in his opening over, the momentum of the Indian innings was too strong to be halted. India&#39;s dominance was evident as they sealed the game comfortably, ensuring an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Ibrahim Zadran | Afghanistan Captain:&quot;We were quite short today. We had a good start but couldn&#39;t maintain that level throughout the innings. Our performance varies; sometimes we excel in the powerplay, other times in the middle overs, or at the death. To prepare for the T20 World Cup, we need to build momentum consistently and avoid repeating our mistakes. Regarding Gulbadin Naib, as our most senior player, we trust him. When he hit a few shots in the powerplay, we wanted him to carry that momentum through the innings.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain: &quot;It&#39;s an incredible feeling to reach 150 T20I caps. This journey, which began in 2007, has been memorable at every step. We&#39;ve been clear about our game plan, and to see the team execute it so well is a matter of pride. It&#39;s one thing to strategize, but quite another to bring those plans to life on the field. These last two games have shown that we&#39;ve been able to check many boxes. Talking about Yashasvi Jaiswal, he&#39;s had a remarkable couple of years, making his mark in both Test and T20I cricket. His talent and range of shots are evident. Shivam Dube, with his power, has shown he can dominate the spinners.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Axar Patel | Player of the Match: &quot;It feels great to realize I&#39;ve reached 200 T20 wickets. What matters most, though, is contributing to the team&#39;s success. The exact number of wickets may not be something I&#39;ll remember years down the line, but performing well for India is what counts. I&#39;ve been focusing on bowling a bit slower and varying my lengths, which has helped me understand the game better. Now, I feel confident bowling at any stage, including the powerplay. In T20 cricket, a bowler must be mentally prepared for any situation.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

India, having secured the series, is brimming with confidence and aims for a clean sweep against Afghanistan. Their batting lineup has been strengthened by Shivam Dube&#39;s stellar fifties, complemented by Virat Kohli&#39;s brisk 16-ball 29, marked by a flurry of boundaries. Additionally, Yashasvi Jaiswal&#39;s explosive 68 in the second game added to the team&#39;s formidable batting display. Axar Patel has been a key player, picking up four wickets in two games and topping the wicket-takers chart, while Arshdeep Singh has also made significant contributions with three wickets, averaging 20. With this match being India&#39;s final international T20 outing before the World Cup, there&#39;s an anticipated exploration of their bench strength.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Afghanistan enters this game following two defeats. Their batting has been commendable, scoring over 150 in both games, but they struggled to defend these totals against a well-settled Indian team. The final match presents an opportunity for a comeback to avoid a series of whitewash and to strive for their first T20I victory against India. Gulbadin Naib&#39;s promotion to number three in the second match proved fruitful, as he impressed with a quick 57 off 35 balls. Karim Janat also had a notable performance with the ball, securing two wickets for just 13 runs in his two-over spell. However, the challenge for Afghanistan has been in converting good starts into impactful innings. The upcoming match at the Chinnaswamy Stadium is anticipated to be high-scoring, considering the ground&#39;s dimensions.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India vs Afghanistan Head-to-Head: In their seven encounters, India has dominated with six victories, while one match concluded with no result. Afghanistan is yet to mark a win against India in these contests.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report|Nick Knight:&nbsp;&quot;The square boundaries measure 60m and 66m, while the straight boundary is about 70m. The pitch looks hard and firm, with some cracks and some grass covering. It might play a bit two-paced but overall, it should be a good pitch for batting.

The seesawing thriller kept fans on the edge of their seats for nearly five hours. India posted 212/2 after a blazing Rohit Sharma ton (121 off 69 balls) lifted them from a perilous 22/4. His special fifth T20I hundred along with Rinku Singh&#39;s unbeaten 65 off 35 balls proved the difference. In the process, Rohit Sharma equals MS Dhoni&#39;s record of 41 wins as India captain. Afghanistan got the perfect launchpad courtesy openers Gurbaz (40) and Ibrahim Zadran (67) adding 93 runs. It set up a chase as 127 runs came in the last 10 overs.

A jubilant India snatched victory on the penultimate ball as Afghanistan finished on 1/2 in heartbreaking fashion.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma | Player of the Match and Indian Captain:<br />\n&quot;I can&#39;t recall the last time something like this happened to me. I remember batting thrice in an IPL game once. Rinku and me needed to maintain our partnership and keep our intent alive, especially in big games. The pressure was on, and it was essential to bat long and deep without losing our aggressive intent. Rinku has been impressive in the last couple of series, demonstrating his capabilities with the bat. He&#39;s calm, knows his strengths well, and is coming of age. His performance is exactly what we need, especially towards the end of the innings. He&#39;s been outstanding in the IPL, and it&#39;s great to see him carry that form into the national team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shivam Dube | Player of the Series:<br />\n&quot;As an all-rounder, being named Player of the Series is a new and fantastic achievement for me. We scored plenty of runs on this ground, and though we thought we&#39;d clinch the win before the super over, cricket can be unpredictable. Both teams did well. I know there are areas, especially in my bowling, that I need to work on, and I&#39;m striving to improve with each game.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Ibrahim Zadran | Afghanistan Captain:<br />\n&quot;We&#39;re pleased with our overall performance in the series. Despite losing in the super over, we played good cricket. We&#39;ve gathered many positives from these matches, and this experience will be beneficial for the upcoming T20 World Cup. The team has given their best in these three games. We&#39;ve played a brand of cricket that we haven&#39;t before, especially against a team like India and in our batting. I&#39;m really happy with our progress. We&#39;ll take the positives from this series and focus on making slight improvements for the T20 World Cup.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The stage is set for a riveting Test contest as India lock horns with England in the first match and ICC World Test Championship cycle at Hyderabad&#39;s Rajiv Gandhi Stadium. This highly-anticipated clash carries valuable Championship points for two teams with contrasting cricketing ideologies.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India boast formidable home dominance, spearheaded by the spin trio of Ashwin, Jadeja and likely Axar. But England have been rejuvenated in Tests under coach McCullum and captain Stokes. Their fearless &#39;Bazball&#39; batting approach has notched up improbable fourth innings chases. However, adapting to spinner-friendly Asian conditions poses a different challenge altogether.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The pitch is expected to progressively assist turn, bringing India&#39;s tweakers into the game as the Test wears on. Unseasonal moisture due to the winter season could give England&#39;s pacers some early assistance. Uneven boundary dimensions also add intrigue to the tactical battle between the two well-matched sides.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For India, Virat Kohli&#39;s absence for the first two Tests opens the door for the likes of Shubman Gill or uncapped Dhruv Jurel. England will also miss in-form Harry Brook. But the inclusions of Leach, rookie spinner Rehan Ahmed and the dependable Ollie Pope bolster a batting lineup itching to make a statement.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As much a battle of wits between the captains as skills between the players, expect fireworks from the word go. Sparks are set to fly as Indian spin takes on English Bazball.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nMurali Kartik and Kevin Pietersen | Pitch Report: &quot;We&#39;re looking at a pitch that&#39;s divided into three distinct parts. Near the batsman, the edges are extremely dry, hinting at likely turn in this area. The center part of the pitch presents a contrast with an even grass cover, but don&#39;t be fooled, it&#39;s dry underneath, signaling dry patches which could play a role. Moving to the opposite side of the wicket, the dryness near the bat is less pronounced, but spin is expected to be a significant factor here. In our view, winning the toss and batting first seems like the strategy to go for, especially with the spinners likely to come into the game quite early.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image (40)_1706158791.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE : <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">England won the toss and elected to bat first&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Ben Stokes | England Captain: &quot;We&#39;re opting to bat first. These conditions are typical for India and our preparation has been solid. We&#39;re aware of the challenge; India is a formidable team. It&#39;s a big day for Hartley, making his debut, and Rehan, who&#39;s relatively new. They&#39;re under the guidance of Leach, a great leader. We also have Woody, who brings that X-factor as a bowler.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma | India Captain: &quot;We would have chosen to bat first too, considering the pitch looks dry. Regardless of whether we bat or bowl first, we&#39;re confident in our team&#39;s abilities. It&#39;s exciting to play a five-match series for the first time. We&#39;re familiar with these conditions and it&#39;s about executing our skills effectively. Our lineup includes three spinners - Axar, Jadeja, and Ashwin, along with two seamers, Bumrah and Siraj. Leaving out Kuldeep Yadav was tough, but Axar&#39;s performance and batting abilities in these conditions gave him the edge.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

On the ropes, after India&#39;s first innings lead, an Ollie Pope epic resuscitated England then bold declarations raised victory hopes. Pope&#39;s twin centuries were the cornerstone but Foakes&#39; support before tailenders Hartley and Ahmed wagged crucially expanding the target. Set 378, India started steadily before losing a clutch of wickets on either side of lunch including the key scalp - Jadeja&#39;s electric run out. Succumbing to scoreboard pressure, Indian blows kept raining down into the gleeful hands of England&#39;s spinners. In the end, England&#39;s daring paid off handsomely while India rued letting matches slip from positions of promise&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma | India Captain &quot;It&#39;s challenging to identify exactly where things didn&#39;t go our way. Holding a 190-run lead, we felt in command, but Ollie Pope&#39;s extraordinary batting, arguably among the finest in Indian conditions, deserves praise. While a target of 230 seemed achievable, it just wasn&#39;t our day. I believe we bowled effectively, targeting the right areas. We&#39;ve reflected on what worked and what didn&#39;t. Nonetheless, one must commend Pope&#39;s performance. It&#39;s difficult to narrow down to just one or two factors. Our batting simply wasn&#39;t strong enough to reach the desired score. An additional 20-30 runs could have made a difference. Our lower order put up a good fight, setting an example for the top order. We missed a few opportunities, but that&#39;s part of the game, especially in the first match of the series.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Ben Stokes| England Captain &quot;Ever since I&#39;ve taken on the captaincy, we&#39;ve experienced many remarkable moments. But this victory, without a doubt, stands as our most incredible achievement, a full 100%. It&#39;s a first for me, coming here as a captain. I&#39;m an avid student of the game; I observed closely how the Indian spinners bowled and how Rohit strategized his field placements. I&#39;m over the moon for everyone in the team. Hartley&#39;s nine wickets and Pope&#39;s performance post his shoulder surgery were exceptional. And then there&#39;s Tom, joining our squad for the first time, to whom we gave a lot of confidence. I was more than willing to let him bowl longer spells. We wholeheartedly support those we choose for the team. Considering the situation we were in, the manner in which he played those shots, scoring 190 on such a pitch, and his skill in manipulating the field - it&#39;s unquestionably the finest innings ever played in the subcontinent by an English batter. In my approach, I don&rsquo;t fear failure; instead, I aim to inspire everyone in the squad.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Ollie Pope | Player of the Match: &quot;Absolutely, this is my best knock, without a doubt. Coming to India, which is the toughest place for a batter, and starting the series like this, this innings stands head and shoulders above my other four hundreds. I admit I had a bit of luck in the second innings. There were a few moments where I played and missed. My focus was on covering the inside edge, and I stayed committed to that mindset throughout. I wanted to maintain a positive approach, especially with my sweep and reverse sweep shots.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>As the cricketing saga unfolds in Visakhapatnam, the India vs England series intensifies with the second Test beginning on February 2. The hosts, trailing by a match in the series, are poised for a comeback on a ground that has historically favored them. The Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, a bastion of hope for the Indian team, has witnessed India&#39;s triumph in its previous outings against England and South Africa, offering a psychological edge amidst the anticipation of a spirited duel. India are navigating through choppy waters with the loss of KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja to injuries, a setback that could potentially disrupt their game plan.<br />\nThe likely inclusion of Rajat Patidar and Kuldeep Yadav signals a recalibration of strategies, focusing on blending youthful energy with strategic acumen to counter England&#39;s prowess. England&#39;s lineup, too, faces a reshuffle with the absence of Jack Leach, paving the way for Shoaib Bashir to possibly make his debut, adding an element of unpredictability to the mix.<br />\nThe pitch at Visakhapatnam, known for its initial batting-friendly conditions that gradually evolve to assist spin, sets the stage for a compelling contest between bat and ball. India&#39;s batting lineup, under scrutiny after their second innings falter in the first Test, is under pressure to deliver, with the team&#39;s hopes of leveling the series resting on their shoulders. The spotlight is on India&#39;s spin trio, who are up against an England batting lineup that boasts depth and versatility, highlighted by Tom Hartley&#39;s remarkable performance in the opening match.<br />\nPersonal milestones await key players like Ashwin, Bumrah, Stokes, and Root, adding a layer of intrigue and personal ambition to the overarching narrative of team success. As both teams lock horns in Visakhapatnam, the match promises not just a test of skills but also a battle of wits</strong>. <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>It&#39;s Bazball vs The Wall - Round 2&nbsp; </strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Eoin Morgan and Dinesh Karthik | Pitch Report, &quot;The pitch is looking magnificent for batting, which should bring smiles to the faces of all English fans. With a top layer of black soil and red soil underneath, the pitch promises some turn, but not excessively so on the first day. It&#39;s a &#39;win the toss and bat first&#39; kind of surface. Both teams are likely to field a strong spin contingent, yet we foresee the spinners playing a more pivotal role later in the match. The batting conditions are expected to be prime over the first two days.&quot;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image - 2024-02-02T093221_1706846723.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS: India won the toss and elected to bat&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharama| India Captain: &quot;We&#39;re going to bat first. The pitch looks good, and though it will have its own character, we need to play quality cricket. What occurred in Hyderabad is now in the past; we have to move forward. We&#39;ve discussed the strategies we need to implement; it&#39;s time to put those plans into action. I believe we batted well in the first innings but lacked the same level of intent. Similarly, in the second innings with the ball, Ollie Pope played a remarkable knock. Injuries are a normal part of the game, and that&#39;s exactly why we have reserves. We&#39;re making two changes that aren&#39;t due to injuries - Jadeja and KL are out, and we&#39;ve decided to give Siraj a rest. Mukesh, Kuldeep, and Rajat Patidar, who is making his debut, are coming in.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Ben Stokes| England Captain:&nbsp; &quot;I would have chosen to bat first as well. Last week was fantastic, but we&#39;re aware that India is going to come back strong. The way we managed to come from behind was incredibly satisfying. We&#39;ll carry that confidence forward, but it&#39;s a new week now. Playing in such an amazing atmosphere is a great experience for the boys. Getting this kind of opportunity at the start of their careers will be a huge boost to their confidence.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

The contest, held on a pitch that held up remarkably well across the days, unfolded with numerous twists that kept fans on the edge of their seats.India, opting to bat after winning the toss, embarked on their innings with a mix of caution and aggression. The opening day saw Yashasvi Jaiswal&#39;s sublime rhythm carve out a second Test ton, even as his fellow batsmen, including Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill, found themselves at odds with England&#39;s precise bowling attack. James Anderson&#39;s mastery over seam and swing claimed Rohit early, but Jaiswal stood tall, his unbeaten 179 steering India to a position of strength.The narrative took a captivating turn on Day 2 as Jaiswal, untroubled by England&#39;s bowlers, soared to a magnificent double century. However, England, showcasing resilience, swiftly dismantled India&#39;s lower order, with Anderson bringing an end to Jaiswal&#39;s majestic innings. India&#39;s first innings concluded at 396, a total that seemed formidable until Jasprit Bumrah unleashed havoc. Bumrah&#39;s six-wicket haul, including his 150th Test wicket, decimated England&#39;s batting lineup, leaving them reeling at 253 by the tea break.Day 3 witnessed Gill&#39;s tenacious century, a knock that exemplified grit amidst England&#39;s spinners clawing back into the game. India set a daunting target of 399, a testament to their batting depth and strategic acumen. England&#39;s chase began with promise, thanks to Zak Crawley&#39;s fluent 73, but was soon derailed by India&#39;s spin wizards, notably Ravichandran Ashwin, who sent Duckett packing early on Day 4.England&#39;s middle order, including Joe Root and Ben Stokes, faltered when resilience was most needed. Root&#39;s dismissal to a rash shot and Stokes&#39;s run out, a result of Iyer&#39;s brilliance in the field, highlighted moments of lapse that England would rue. Despite the pitch offering minimal turn, England&#39;s challenge fizzled, ending their pursuit at 292.This victory for India wasn&#39;t just about the numbers on the scoreboard; it was a showcase of their ability to dominate across all facets of the game &ndash; from Jaiswal&#39;s masterclass and Bumrah&#39;s fiery spells to the strategic field settings and crucial run-outs. England, while showing flashes of brilliance, will look back at missed opportunities and lapses in judgment that cost them dearly&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Ben Stokes | England Captain: Heading into the final innings, we had unwavering faith in our ability to chase down the target. It&#39;s in high-pressure situations like these, with the scoreboard looming over us, that we truly excel. It was yet another phenomenal match to experience. We have a clear understanding in our team&mdash;there are no prescriptions for how to play. Each player in our dressing room possesses immense quality, capable of evaluating the conditions and deciding their approach. I thoroughly enjoyed leading our spinners; their performance yesterday was nothing short of remarkable, displaying wisdom well beyond their years. And what can I say about Anderson? He, alongside Bumrah, stands out as an incredible bowler.&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma reflects on the match, &quot;Indeed, Bumrah is a pivotal player for us, consistently proving his worth. Overall, our performance was commendable. These conditions were challenging, but we managed well, which I&#39;m pleased about.Yashasvi Jaiswal is showing great promise. He adapts well to various situations, though there&#39;s much ahead for him. His first innings was outstanding, and I hope he maintains his humility and focus on the team&#39;s needs.The pitch favored batting, yet we saw starts not fully capitalized into significant scores, a point for us to consider. With many in our squad being new to Test cricket, it&#39;s crucial to bolster their confidence and encourage free play.I&#39;m immensely proud of our young team, especially facing off against a formidable opponent like England, who took the first Test. It underscores the importance of patience and support for our emerging talents. Facing challenges motivates us. England has shown exceptional form in the past two years, making our victory in this match particularly satisfying. However, we&#39;re aware the series isn&#39;t concluded, and we aim to maintain this level of performance in the matches to come.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jasprit Bumrah| Player of the Match,&quot;Nowadays, I don&#39;t dwell on stats too much. In my younger days, I&#39;d get caught up in them, but I&#39;ve learned they can weigh you down. The real triumph for me is contributing to the team&#39;s win, and that&#39;s where my focus lies.My journey with the yorker started early, inspired by cricket legends like Waqar and Zaheer I watched on TV. It became the first delivery I mastered.I wouldn&#39;t call myself a leader per se, but having played a fair share of cricket during this transition phase, I see it as my duty to pass on knowledge to the newer members of the team.Rohit and I have come a long way together. Our discussions often revolve around strategizing and learning from our experiences on the field.My passion for fast bowling goes beyond playing the sport. I&#39;m a fan first and foremost. Watching great fast bowling performances is something I genuinely enjoy, so I don&#39;t see it as a competition but rather something that brings me joy.Whenever there&#39;s a challenge on the field, I focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on the problem.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Following their win in the second Test, India is buoyant. Jasprit Bumrah played a crucial role, devastating the English batting lineup with his fierce bowling, claiming 9 wickets and securing the Player of the Match award. With the bat, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill were impressive; Jaiswal celebrated his maiden double century, while Gill&#39;s crucial century in the second innings helped India set a formidable target of 399 runs. India is keen to continue this winning momentum into the third match.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>England, on the other hand, is determined to create history in Ben Stokes&#39; landmark 100th game, aiming to achieve what no visiting team has accomplished in over a decade: defeating India more than once in a series on their home soil. The return of Mark Wood is set to enhance England&#39;s bowling arsenal as he joins forces with James Anderson to spearhead the new-ball attack. The stage is set for an intriguing contest as the crucial game unfolds.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:<br />\nDeep Dasgupta and Nick Knight: &quot;Looks like a fantastic wicket. A little bit two-toned, with some dry cracks near the wickets but as we move down, there&rsquo;s a nice covering of grass and it&rsquo;s hard as well. There&rsquo;s a green tinge, enough in the surface for the fast bowlers. Little bit of rough outside the stumps but not much for the spinners - at least in the first couple of days. There&rsquo;s some moisture as we go towards the business end of the pitch. There are cracks but they might not open up soon. Great batting surface. The grass might help the seamers early on and an aggressive captain might bowl first. Day two and three will be very good to bat.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image - 2024-02-15T110112_1707981677.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Toss:-</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India won the toss and elected to bat!</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: &quot;We&#39;re going to bat first.

There was no cricket, we got the families out, it was great. Being here for so long is both physically and mentally demanding.

The second innings witnessed Yashasvi Jaiswal&#39;s explosive double century, bolstered by significant contributions from Sarfaraz Khan and Shubman Gill, setting an imposing target of 557. England&#39;s pursuit crumbled under the pressure, with Jadeja&#39;s spin web claiming a five-for and folding England for just 122</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Ben Stokes, England Captain: &quot;Duckett played an unbelievable innings. That was the tone we wanted to set throughout the innings. It was about identifying that opportunity and getting as close to India&#39;s score. We wanted to bowl yesterday but it was earlier than when we wanted. Sometimes gameplans don&#39;t work and that was the case this time around. Everyone&#39;s got a perception and opinion about things, the people in the dressing room are what matters to us. 1-2 down in the series and a great opportunity for us to come back and win the series from here. We leave this game behind and we know we have to win the next 2 games to win the series and that&#39;s what we would look to do.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, Indian Captain: &quot;When you play Test cricket, you don&#39;t play it in two or three days. You have to stay in the game for five days. They played good shots and put us under pressure but we&#39;ve got class in our squad when it comes to bowling. We stuck to our plans on day three, and when those things happen, it&#39;s a delight. Jadeja at No. 5 For this game, we thought he had so much experience in this format, and scored a lot of runs of late. We also wanted left-right batting as well. Sarfaraz being Sarfaraz, we know his quality, we wanted him to have some time before he comes out to bat. Lots of turning points. That was a good toss to win. We know runs on board are important in India. The lead was also crucial for us. The way we came out to bowl after the English batters&#39; onslaught, important to stay calm. The bowlers showed a lot of character. Not to forget we didn&#39;t have our most experienced bowler too. Was proud to watch the bowlers do well in his absence. Then in our second innings, we knew half the job was done. We wanted to extend the lead, and the two youngsters helped extend it. Jaiswal I&#39;ve spoken a lot about him. I&#39;m sure people outside the changing room have also been talking about him. I want to be calm about him, not talk a lot about him. He&#39;s started his career on a high.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja: &quot;I was just looking to build partnerships with Rohit, we were in a difficult situation, look to back my strengths, play my shots, not try and be more conscious. Watch the ball and play the ball. I know about this wicket, if we bat first, it is always good to bat on, in the second half it starts spinning, when Rohit won the toss, we were thinking: this is all that we wanted, bat first bowl second. On this wicket you won&#39;t get easy wickets, you have to work hard for it. You need to throw balls in good areas, you have to earn your wickets.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The crucial fourth Test between India and England kicks off at JSCA Stadium in Ranchi, with the riveting series tantalizingly poised at 2-1 in the home side&#39;s favor. India have shown great character in the last two games, comprehensively outplaying England in Visakhapatnam and Rajkot respectively to overturn the opening Test loss in Hyderabad. They will be eager to carry the winning momentum by taking an unassailable 3-1 series lead in Ranchi. However, they have opted to rest strike pacer Jasprit Bumrah, which poses a selection dilemma. For England, only a victory can help square the series and sustain their sensational run under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum.In 134 previous encounters, India have won 33 Tests compared to England&#39;s 51 victories, with 50 ending in draws. But recent history favors the hosts who have bounced back smartly after the opening loss. The Ranchi pitch is expected to offer sharp turns early on, unlike the previous surfaces. England are unsure how it will play, with Stokes admitting he has never seen anything like it. They struggled against spin in Hyderabad and India will hope playing two spinners now can cement their dominance.With both sides boasting high-quality batting lineups and the rub of the green going India&#39;s way lately, another thriller could be on the cards. England&#39;s attacking &quot;Bazball&quot; method will be fully tested against the seasoned Indian spin duo of Ashwin and Jadeja on a potentially unpredictable track.<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"> England won the toss and elected to bat first&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Ben Stokes|England Captain: &quot;Opting to bat first is our decision. Being 2-1 down, this match holds added significance in the series context, but every game is crucial. The initial hour will provide insights into the pitch, but it was always expected to be a track favoring batting. My bowling form has been promising after a prolonged period, and I&#39;m satisfied with our overall performance in the series. Looking forward to maintaining the same momentum.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma|India Captain: &quot;Choosing to bat first would have been our preference. The pitch appears a bit dry with some cracks, which is typical for this venue. Following our successful performances in the last two games, we aim to continue in the same vein. I take pride in the young players in our squad; they&#39;ve embraced responsibility and confronted challenges confidently. Their belief in their skills is commendable, and it bodes well for the future. We&#39;re making one change, with Akash Deep making his debut.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

The heroics began with openers Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who set the tone with an 84-run partnership, highlighted by Rohit&#39;s masterful fifty. Despite England&#39;s brief comeback, the day belonged to India&#39;s young guns, Shubman Gill and Dhruv Jurel, whose unyielding partnership navigated India past England&#39;s challenge. England&#39;s attempt to tilt the scales, featuring Joe Root&#39;s strategic bowling change and Tom Hartley&#39;s vital wicket, was overshadowed by India&#39;s resilience. Shoaib Bashir&#39;s efforts for England, albeit commendable, were eclipsed by the brilliance of India&#39;s batting lineup, as Gill&#39;s composed fifty and Jurel&#39;s crucial innings underlined the depth and talent in the Indian squad. The Indian spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Kuldeep Yadav spun a web around the English batsmen, setting up the victory chase with exceptional bowling performances. Ashwin, with a significant five-wicket haul, and Yadav&#39;s timely strikes dismantled England&#39;s batting, proving India&#39;s dominance on home soil. This victory not only extended India&#39;s winning streak in the Test series at home but also reinforced their status as a formidable force in world cricket. England, despite showing moments of brilliance, fell short, marking their first series defeat under the new leadership duo of Stokes and McCullum. As India celebrated, the cricketing world witnessed the rise of new heroes, solidifying India&#39;s legacy in the sport.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Ben Stokes (England Captain):</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;Absolutely, this was an incredible Test match. The scoreboard might show a win for India by five wickets, yet that doesn&#39;t fully encapsulate the journey of these five days. Tom Hartley stepped up impressively, gaining invaluable experience early in his career, which is fantastic. I&#39;m immensely proud of our young spinners. That&#39;s just how I am, both personally and as a captain. I encourage taking each ball as a unique moment, without worrying about the future. Facing India at home is undoubtedly daunting, but my faith in our bowlers was unwavering. We&#39;re all huge advocates for Test cricket, and I&#39;m optimistic about its future. We&#39;ve had our moments of excellence. When it was our turn to bat, facing the trio of Ashwin, Jadeja, and Kuldeep on these pitches was a formidable challenge. I&#39;d hesitate to call it impossible because there&#39;s always a possibility, but it was certainly a difficult phase for us.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma (India Captain): &quot;It&#39;s undeniable that this series was fiercely contested. Coming out on top after four grueling Test matches is immensely satisfying. The entire team faced numerous challenges throughout the series, and I&#39;m proud of how we tackled each one. We remained focused on our goals and executed our plans with calmness, which brings me great joy.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The journey to this point, through years of dedication in domestic and club cricket, has been rigorous for our players. Stepping into Test cricket presents a significant challenge, yet the attitude and responses I receive from the team are incredibly reassuring. Together with Rahul bhai, my role is to foster a supportive environment where the players feel confident and focused on their performance without undue pressure. They&#39;re eager to prove themselves, and we believe in allowing them to pursue their objectives without constant reminders, as they come into the squad with a clear vision of their responsibilities.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Dhruv Jurel (Player of the Match): &quot;I always aim to adapt to the current situation of the game. In our final innings, we needed runs since we were batting last. My focus was on contributing as much as possible, knowing the chase wouldn&#39;t be too daunting.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The partnership at that moment was crucial, and I was batting with the tailenders who showed remarkable skill and determination. They deserve a lot of credit for their performance.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Facing Anderson was an incredible experience. Watching him bowl on TV over the years and then facing him in person, I knew I had to play each ball on its merit.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Gill and I set ourselves mini-goals, aiming for ten runs at a time. Our strategy was to build a partnership that would distance us from defeat and edge us closer to victory.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India and England are set to clash in the fifth and concluding Test at the picturesque Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala. With the series already in their grasp at 3-1, India steps into the final game riding a wave of confidence bolstered by significant individual performances. Overcoming an initial 0-1 deficit, battling to 33/3 in the pivotal third game, and surmounting the mid-game loss of Ashwin, India&rsquo;s path to a 3-1 series lead has been nothing short of dramatic. Despite the absence of stalwarts like Kohli and Rahul&#39;s early departure, the team has showcased remarkable resilience, with younger players stepping up splendidly. Yashasvi Jaiswal has been a revelation, amassing 655 runs at an impressive average of 93.57 over 8 innings, supported by Shubman Gill&rsquo;s vital 342 runs. Dhruv Jurel and Sarfaraz Khan have made noteworthy debuts, translating their domestic form onto the international stage. The Indian bowling unit, a blend of seasoned and new faces, exhibited both discipline and aggression.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>England, however, might rue missed opportunities after taking an early lead in the series. Despite strong performances, sporadic lapses in focus led to their undoing, missing out on what could have been a historic series victory. The seasoned trio of Root, Bairstow, and Stokes failed to meet expectations, with none maintaining an average over 30. While Anderson&rsquo;s haul of 8 wickets was modest, newcomers Hartley and Bashir showed promise with 20 and 12 wickets, respectively. As Dharamsala gears up to mark both Bairstow Ashwin&rsquo;s 100th Test, England eyes a strong comeback to conclude the series on a positive note while India look to end the series on high.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nToss: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">England Won the toss and elected to bat&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Ben Stokes | England Captain: &quot;We&#39;ve decided to bat first. The pitch indeed looks promising. Looking back at the outcomes and our achievements over the past two months, the experience gained and the progress demonstrated by some of our players has been significantly positive. While we wish our standings were better, it&#39;s been a beneficial tour for many.Jonny stands out as one of our top players across formats. Playing 100 Test matches is a testament to his dedication and passion for the game. Witnessing him receive his cap alongside his family was a touching moment. He&#39;s a profoundly dedicated and emotional individual. I&#39;m looking forward to a memorable performance from him this week.We&#39;re making a single change in the lineup. Mark Wood will be replacing Ollie Robinson. His skill set is well known to us, and we aimed to retain two spinners as the match advances.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain: &quot;We were aiming to bat first too. Every Test match played for India holds great importance. We&#39;ve entered this series with a streak of victories and have performed commendably so far. This presents another chance for us to conclude the series on a high note.The pitch looks promising. It&#39;s somewhat hard, which suggests it should offer good bounce and prove to be favorable for batting. I don&#39;t anticipate it deteriorating significantly. However, as the match progresses, it might become a bit slower.This venue is among the finest globally, and we thoroughly enjoy playing here. The ground is magnificent, the pitch excellent, and the outfield splendid.Ashwin has been a cornerstone for Indian cricket for a lengthy period. It&#39;s a monumental achievement for him, his family, and the entire country. As a team, we&#39;re eager to support him as he continues to weave the magic he&#39;s known for over the years. He&#39;s achieved a lot, and I hope he keeps on delivering.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We&#39;re making two adjustments to the team. Bumrah returns, replacing Akash Deep. Also, due to an injury sustained in training yesterday evening, Patidar is out, and Padikkal will be making his debut.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Over three days, India&#39;s all-around supremacy was on full display, outmatching England in every department and underlining their deserved series win.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Test unfolded with England winning the toss and opting to bat, a decision that initially seemed promising but quickly unraveled. Zak Crawley shone briefly with a knock of 79, and Duckett contributed 27, but the rest of the batting lineup, including Root and Bairstow who reached their 20s, and Ben Foakes with 24, failed to capitalize, resulting in England&#39;s first innings closing at 218. Kuldeep Yadav starred for India, claiming 5 wickets, supported by Ashwin&#39;s four and Jadeja&#39;s single wicket.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, India&#39;s batting lineup, led by centuries from Rohit Sharma (103) and Shubman Gill (110), laid a solid foundation. Contributions from Yashasvi Jaiswal (57), debutant Devdutt Padikkal (65), and Sarfaraz Khan (56) propelled India to a total of 477, setting a daunting lead of 259 runs. England&#39;s bowlers, despite Bashir&#39;s five-wicket haul, couldn&#39;t stem the flow of runs, with Anderson achieving a personal milestone of 700 Test wickets.England&#39;s batting woes continued into their second innings, with top-order failures compounding their difficulties. Despite a valiant effort from Root, and a brief resistance from Bashir, England couldn&#39;t overcome the deficit, succumbing before the Tea break on Day 3.This victory in Dharamshala wasn&#39;t just a win but a statement from India, showcasing their depth and skill across all facets of the game. England, while showing flashes of potential, will rue their missed opportunities and inability to capitalize on crucial moments. As India celebrates a well-earned series victory, the performances of key players on both sides will be remembered, but it&#39;s India&#39;s comprehensive team effort that ultimately defined this series.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Ben Stokes | England Captain: &quot;As the series concludes, I must admit there&#39;s nothing left to hold back. We&#39;ve had to face the fact that we were outplayed by what is, undeniably, the best team in the world. There are, however, many positives we can carry forward into the summer. With plenty of cricket ahead, there&#39;s no room for concern. It&#39;s those critical, small moments we let slip away, but such is the nature of playing at this level. Understanding how to maintain our game when India gains momentum is crucial; they know how to press their advantage. It&#39;s about embracing the challenge, being willing to take calculated risks without feeling overwhelmed. Our focus should have been on better application on the field.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Kuldeep Yadav | Player of the Match: &quot;This recognition is a testament to the hard work I&#39;ve put in over the last few years, and now, I&#39;m reaping the rewards. My performance in Ranchi was particularly satisfying; despite the slow pitch, I managed to utilize the drift effectively. The wickets of Stokes in Ranchi and Crawley, with that exceptional delivery, were highlights for me. My approach is to concentrate on delivering a good length, which is crucial for a spinner in any format, without overly worrying about the batter&#39;s intentions. I&#39;m really pleased with my rhythm. A big shoutout to our batting coach, who has been instrumental not only in honing my skills but also in bolstering my mental game. His constant support during practice sessions has been invaluable.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Yashasvi Jaiswal | Player of the Series: &quot;I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed the series and am really satisfied with my performance throughout. My mindset was clear&mdash;if there&#39;s an opportunity to dominate a bowler, I&#39;ll seize it without hesitation. My focus has been on taking each game as it comes while constantly looking for ways to contribute to the team&#39;s success and maintaining our winning momentum.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma | Indian Captain &quot;Winning a Test like this requires everything to click perfectly. We&#39;re aware that players will leave and new ones will join, and though these new players might lack experience, they&#39;ve played enough cricket to understand pressure situations. I&#39;m proud to say they&#39;ve responded admirably to the challenge. The whole team deserves credit for this achievement; it&#39;s been a joy to witness. Winning a series of this caliber isn&#39;t just about amassing runs or centuries; taking 20 wickets is crucial for victory. Seeing our bowlers step up and take responsibility was truly heartening. Over time, Kuldeep and I have had discussions acknowledging his potential. Despite the pressure in the first innings and his comeback post-injury, he bowled brilliantly. His dedication, especially seen in his batting, has been one of the most rewarding aspects to observe. As for Jaiswal, he&#39;s just at the beginning of what promises to be an exciting journey. His ability to pressure the bowlers right from the start is a rare talent. He&#39;s up for the challenges ahead, embodying resilience and a passion for scoring big. This series has been a phenomenal showcase of his skills and mindset.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

In their warm-up game against Bangladesh at the same venue, key players like Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya found form with the bat. The entire Indian bowling unit impressed, securing a massive 60-run victory. However, the New York pitch behaves differently from the high-scoring tracks in the IPL, making high scores challenging. The experience of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will be crucial, and India&rsquo;s bowling attack, led by Jasprit Bumrah, aims to dominate.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other hand, Ireland faces this match after a defeat to Sri Lanka in their warm-up game. Although they restricted Sri Lanka to 163 runs, their batting lineup struggled against Sri Lanka&rsquo;s bowlers. Ireland boasts experienced players like Paul Stirling, Andrew Balbirnie, and Niall O&rsquo;Brien Tucker. Their bowling unit, featuring Joshua Little, Mark Adair, and Curtis Campher, makes them a formidable opponent. Known for winning big games, Ireland aims to start their World Cup campaign with a victory.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India vs Ireland Head-To-Head:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the seven matches contested between the two teams, India have dominated the contest with winning all seven games while Ireland are yet to open their win account..<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/ICC 2024 Head to Head - 640px width (1)_1717510900.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nShaun Pollock and Ebony Rainford-Brent: &quot;The square boundaries are 63 meters and 72 meters. The Straight boundary is 74 meters. The outfield, which was sluggish in the last game, has been given an extra cut. The track looks okay. It&#39;s pitch number four, The game between South Africa and Sri Lanka was played on pitch number one. India managed 180 in the warm-up fixture at the venue.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">INDIA</span> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">has won the toss and has elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &nbsp;We will field first.

Playing on a similar pitch and don&#39;t know what to expect a little bit. I know it&#39;s going to be slightly different from what we&#39;re used to. But that&#39;s what the sport is. Unsure about the conditions so having a target in front of us would be good. &nbsp;Kuldeep Yadav, Sanju Samson, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Chahal miss out.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Paul Stirling, Ireland Skipper: &quot;Tri-Series in the Netherlands gave us good preparation time.

We needed to put a bit of pressure back on the Indian bowlers but failed to do so. They kept hitting good lengths and gave nothing away. We&#39;ll be back here for a couple of days. Will give it a good crack against Canada.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &nbsp;I said it at the toss as well. Quite unsure of what to expect from the pitch. Not aware of what it is to play on a pitch that&#39;s five months old. I don&#39;t think the wicket settled down even when we batted second. There was enough for the bowlers. That&#39;s pretty much what you gotta do. Try to hit those lengths consistently. Arshdeep&#39;s two wickets upfront set the tone for us. &nbsp;If conditions are there for seamers, we wanted to have that. Spin will play a part later on. Today was a four-seamer pitch and we still managed to get two spinners who are all-rounders. I don&#39;t know what to expect from the pitch, to be honest.</strong></span></p>\n",

The Pakistani bowlers, led by the dynamic duo of Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf, who bagged three wickets each, kept India to a modest score of 119. Amidst the tussle for runs, Rishabh Pant emerged as the top contributor for India, crafting a pivotal 42 off 31 balls.The chase by Pakistan was marked by caution, with the openers initially holding fort. The fall of Babar Azam&rsquo;s wicket to the crafty Jasprit Bumrah was a turning point. Usman Khan and Mohammad Rizwan then stitched together a partnership of 47 runs, only for Axar Patel to break it with his very first delivery.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hold your breath! This encounter witnessed India defending the lowest total in their T20I history and Pakistan faltering in a chase that seemed within grasp. The poignant sight of Naseem Shah, consoled by Shaheen Afridi, captured the emotional intensity of the match. Both teams displayed exemplary grit on a pitch that was less than forgiving, living up to the legendary India-Pakistan rivalry.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jasprit Bumrah was the architect of the defense, ending with an impressive 4-0-14-3. Mohammed Siraj&rsquo;s economical spell and Hardik Pandya&rsquo;s late-game heroics, with figures of 2 for 6 in his final overs, were instrumental in turning the tide after an expensive start.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A STIRRING COMEBACK! The Men in Blue have etched another memorable win! Exhilaration fills the Indian camp, while Pakistan, despite being the early favorites, faces a second successive setback. India&rsquo;s strategy of tight bowling, conceding just a handful of runs per over, and applying pressure at critical moments paid off handsomely. Despite the rain&rsquo;s interruptions, the spirit of the game shone through, ensuring that an India vs. Pakistan clash is always a spectacle to behold!</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jasprit Bumrah | Player of the Match: &quot;Yeah, it feels really good to win this one, especially since we felt our score was a bit under par with the sun coming out. We had to be disciplined with the ball, and I&#39;m really happy with how we performed. I try to keep things simple when I bowl&mdash;just hitting the seam and letting the pitch do the rest. The cheer from the crowd felt like we were playing in India; it&rsquo;s always appreciated and gives us a lot of energy. You know, we just focus on the now, we&rsquo;ve played two games and played them well. Nothing changes; we stick to our process and come out and try to execute the plan.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Babar Azam&nbsp; | Pakistan Captain:&quot;I think we bowled well after the 10th over and restricted them to 120, which was a good effort here. We started well but lost back-to-back wickets which didn&#39;t help. We played too many dot balls, and that period really hurt us. We didn&rsquo;t take the game deep enough. We always try to utilize the first six overs, but we didn&#39;t manage to do that today. The pitch was decent; the ball was coming onto the bat nicely, although a few balls stayed low, which is okay for drop-in pitches. We have to sit down and discuss our approach for the last two games.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma&nbsp; | India Captain:&quot;I think we didn&rsquo;t bat well enough today. Being 80 for 3 at one stage, you expect the guys to build a partnership. We were probably 15-20 runs short. But, honestly, it was a good wicket compared to the last two we played on here; 140 would have been a fighting score. With our bowling attack, you always feel confident that the boys can do the job. It&#39;s about the never say die attitude in our team. We only had 119 on the board, so we needed to make early inroads, which we didn&rsquo;t. At the halfway stage of their innings, we regrouped and reminded ourselves that if things can happen to us, they can happen to them as well.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Their recent victory against Pakistan, a thrilling six-run win on a sluggish track, highlighted their tactical acumen.

It has played better in the last two games we&#39;ve observed, but it&#39;s crucial to understand what you need to do in the middle and assess the conditions quickly, letting the game unfold naturally. It&#39;s about constantly improving our own game, understanding what is required at a specific point in time, and keeping the momentum going. We need to continue doing the right things as we did in the last two games. That was a great game to play against Pakistan. We didn&#39;t have many runs on the board, but the bowlers stepped up and did the job.

The partnership between Yadav and Dube was the cornerstone of a victory that was as much about mental fortitude as it was about cricketing prowess..This triumph was India&rsquo;s third on the trot, a hat-trick that propelled them into the Super 8 with a swagger.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of The Match: Arshdeep Singh</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Arshdeep Singh : &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m very happy with my performance. In the last two games, I gave away too many runs, but I&#39;m pleased with how I bowled today. The management keeps backing me, and I&#39;m glad I could step up.The wicket is helping us fast bowlers get some seam movement. It was good to bowl here, and I tried to hit the right areas.The talk in the dressing room was about not giving away easy balls to score because our batters would have to work hard to get those runs.In these conditions, you can execute your skills and try to take advantage of the conditions. I spoke with Jasprit, and he said to focus on bowling yorkers.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Aaron Jones | United States of America Skipper: &quot;I would say we were 10-15 runs short on that wicket. If we had reached 120-125, it would have been a tougher total. The boys were pretty disciplined today. I&#39;m proud of how close we got to the win.The crowd support was great. We have been encouraging fans to come out and support USA cricket, and it was good to see them here.We will revamp, travel tomorrow, and come back harder against Ireland in the next game.We didn&#39;t use spinners today because the wicket was tricky against seam bowling. I thought the seamers were the best options&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma | India Skipper: &quot;We knew it was going to be tough to score those runs. Credit to us for holding our nerves, and to Surya and Dube for taking responsibility and leading the team.I&#39;m very happy to see their progress in cricket. They are getting stronger and I wish them the best. They are hardworking guys making their mark.We knew the bowlers had to lead. Run scoring is difficult here, and all the bowlers did their job, especially Arshdeep. His start was magnificent.Regarding Dube bowling, we want options. We&#39;ll use them as needed. Having options moving forward is crucial.Super 8s is a big relief. Playing here wasn&#39;t easy. In all three games, you had to stick to the end. Luckily, we managed to pull through in all three.Surya showed his versatility. That&#39;s what you expect from experienced players. His partnership with Dube was brilliant and took us home.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

The air is thick with anticipation, yet a huge chance of rain looms large, threatening to dampen the spirits of this high-voltage contest</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India strides into the arena, their place in the Super 8s already secured, poised to infuse fresh energy in the XI. The spotlight, however, shines brightest on Virat Kohli, whose bat has been uncharacteristically silent. Today, he stands on the cusp of a resurgence, ready to silence critics and rediscover his golden touch.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Canada, though out of the Super 8 fray, has displayed the heart of a lion. Their campaign, marked by a valiant victory over Ireland and a commendable stand against the USA, has been a narrative of grit and determination. They now face their sternest challenge yet, eager to exit the stage with heads held high.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Indian contingent has been a fortress of consistency, with Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, and Hardik Pandya leading the charge with the ball. Rishabh Pant has been the anchor with the bat, ably supported by Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav, while Shivam Dube&rsquo;s recent form promises fireworks.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As the weather gods cast their dice, the possibility of play hangs by a thread. But should the skies clear, expect a spectacle of cricket where every delivery, every run, and every moment is laced with drama and excitement.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s journey has been a blend of dominance and resilience, exemplified in their chase against the USA. Canada&rsquo;s spirited displays against Ireland and Pakistan have shown they can punch above their weight.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With India looking to keep their slate clean and Canada aiming to bow out with a bang, all eyes are on the heavens to spare us their tears. The pitch remains shrouded a silent witness to the suspense. If fortune favours the brave and the clouds part, we&rsquo;re in for a T20I&nbsp; feast that will be etched in memory.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>[7:30 PM IST]: The Toss has been delayed |&nbsp; Inspection at 8 PM IST&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n[8:10 PM IST]: Next Inspection at 9 PM IST<br />\n<br />\nMatch Abandoned Without A Ball Bowled!</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India and Afghanistan are poised to begin their Super 8 campaigns at the ICC Men&#39;s T20 World Cup, facing off in match number 43 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India comes into this match buoyed by an impressive group stage performance, notching three wins and one no-result. Their bowling has been a standout feature, consistently stifling opponents on challenging pitches, while their batting has shown flashes of brilliance, with various players rising to the occasion in crucial moments.&nbsp;This encounter marks India&#39;s first game in the West Indies for this tournament, and they are expected to adapt quickly. The pitch conditions in Barbados, known for aiding both seam and spin, should suit the Indian team, which boasts depth in both departments. India also maintains a spotless record against Afghanistan in T20 internationals, a statistic they are eager to uphold.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, Afghanistan entered the tournament with a strong start, securing wins in their first three matches with balanced contributions from both batsmen and bowlers. However, a recent defeat to the West Indies exposed some vulnerabilities, particularly in their fielding and tactical execution.&nbsp;Key players for Afghanistan include Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran, who have been prolific with the bat, and Fazalhaq Farooqi, who has led the bowling attack with vigor, supported by the seasoned duo of Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed.&nbsp;They will look to leverage this familiarity and their formidable spin arsenal to rebound from their recent loss and challenge a formidable Indian side in what promises to be a thrilling contest.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head-To-Head in T20Is:</strong><br />\nIn eight matches contested between the two teams, India have dominated the contest with seven wins while one game ended in no-result.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width_1718871074.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>ICC Men&#39;s T20 World Cup 2024- Stats at Kensington Oval.</strong><br />\n<br />\nAt this venue, the outcome of the five matches played has been fairly balanced. Teams batting first have secured two wins, while teams chasing have also claimed two victories; one game concluded with no result. The average score for the first innings at this venue stands at 144.

When breaking down their performance by the two host nations, the USA and the West Indies, distinct differences emerge. In the USA, the average dips to 17 with a strike rate falling below 100, indicating tougher batting conditions. Conversely, in the West Indies, the average improves to 21, and the strike rate increases to 122, suggesting slightly more favorable conditions for batting.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nAmong the teams that have advanced to the Super 8, Afghanistan&#39;s top order leads with an impressive average of 36.27. Australia and England follow closely, with averages of 33.90 and 29.70, respectively. Notably, India&#39;s top order has managed an average of 24.14, performing significantly better than the overall average of 17 in the USA, highlighting their adaptability and resilience in challenging conditions.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI( ICC 2024) Stats Temp (5)_1718883297.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nIan Smith &amp; Sunil Gavaskar: &quot; Strong breeze towards the ocean that reckons hitting at bigger boundary might be an issue at the venue. &nbsp;It would be lovely to have a bat even at this age.

India, batting first, set a formidable total of 181 runs for 8 wickets in 20 overs. Suryakumar Yadav led the charge with a blistering 53 off 28 balls, supported by Hardik Pandya&#39;s 32 and Rishabh Pant&#39;s quickfire 20.

This is the first for a batter, and I hope it&#39;s the first of many. Facing Rashid Khan is always tough; he&#39;s challenging to get away. Adjusting from the US to the West Indies, it&#39;s crucial to have a clear game plan. Putting the team first is essential when you step out there. I remember telling Hardik not to leave too much for the end when the ball gets old and starts reversing.

However, the match result is what matters most. We&#39;ve enjoyed playing cricket everywhere, but our mindset is crucial. If the conditions are favourable, we&#39;ll adapt our strategy based on whether it&#39;s a batting or bowling track.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &nbsp;&quot;The last two years, we&#39;ve played T20s here, so we understand the conditions and planned accordingly. We adapted well and scored 180, which was a great effort from the batters. Our bowlers were exceptional, defending the total perfectly. Everyone came in and did their job, which is critical and something we focus on. The partnership between Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya was crucial at that point; we needed someone to bat deep, and they did just that. We all know Bumrah&#39;s class and what he can do. It&#39;s important for us to use him smartly regardless of conditions. He&#39;s always willing to take responsibility and has been doing it for years. Regarding the three-spinner combination, we have to assess the conditions and the opposition, and based on that, we&#39;re open to making changes if required. We felt that three spinners were the right choice here, but if the conditions are more seamer-friendly next time, we&#39;ll go with more seamers.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

I just tried to bowl wide, which is my delivery. But the batter had already decided to hit there, so it was about staying one step ahead.As a group, we can get better. We are losing wickets in bunches during the middle stage, and we can improve that. But apart from that, we are looking good.For me, this World Cup is very special. I&#39;m very fortunate to play for my country. It was a freak injury. I tried to come back, but god had other plans, and I couldn&#39;t make it. I always believe, and I was speaking to Rahul sir the other day. We said that luck comes to people who work hard. That&#39;s what I have been doing for the past few months, and I&#39;m happy to be here.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto | Bangladesh Skipper:&quot;We were looking to restrict India to around 160 or 170. That would have been good for us. But credit to them for the way they played.It wasn&#39;t too hot when we batted. All the players are well-versed in these conditions.I think we had a lot of batting options today, but we didn&#39;t show the intent we needed. Chasing 190-odd, you need to go hard in the powerplay.I tried to bat well in every game and contribute, but I had to finish the game, which I didn&#39;t. I should have finished the game. Tanzim Hasan Sakib has done a great job in this tournament. I should also mention Rishad Hossain. We have been looking for a leg-spinner for a while, and it&#39;s good to have him.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Skipper:&quot;I have been talking about that for a long time. It&#39;s just about going out there and putting in the work. We know how to go out there and work. We did well to adapt to the conditions. Wind is a factor here, and you have to adapt to it. We were smart with the bat and adjusted well with the conditions here with the ball.All the batters need to play their roles, whatever they are. We saw only one batter get to 50 and still get to 190. It&#39;s not about getting to 50s or 100s. It&#39;s about going out there and playing their roles. Obviously, we have to adapt to the conditions, but we have a lot of experience in the side, and we want to back them to play their roles.Hardik&#39;s form puts us in a good position. Hardik being Hardik. We know what he is capable of, and he showed what he can do with the bat. He&#39;s a very important player for us. If he can do that, we will be in very good positions.&nbsp;You talk a lot off the field, but executing it on the field is different. We asked the bowlers to do some things on the field, and they delivered.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St. Lucia braces for a high-stakes T20 World Cup Super 8s clash. India, the undefeated juggernaut, takes on a slightly battered Australia, desperate to avoid an early knockout.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s batting has been a fortress, with experienced campaigners Kohli and Rohit Sharma laying the groundwork. While they haven&#39;t unleashed their full potential yet, the middle order, led by the explosive Hardik Pandya, is a ticking time bomb. Their bowling attack boasts the wily Kuldeep Yadav and the fiery pace duo of Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh, a formidable unit ready to dismantle any batting lineup.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Australia, on the other hand, is in unfamiliar territory. Strategic blunders and individual woes have left them scrambling. Their shocking loss to Afghanistan still hangs heavy, and they face a must-win situation against India.Warner and Maxwell need to stand tall against India&#39;s bowling might. While their pace attack with Cummins and Starc can challenge any batsman, Australia needs more than just firepower to overcome India&#39;s juggernaut.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAs the cricketing cosmos gears up for this colossal clash, St. Lucia becomes the gladiatorial arena where heroes will emerge or falter. This isn&rsquo;t just a tussle of bat and ball; it&rsquo;s a tale of grit, strategy, and the unyielding spirit of the game.Who will rise to the occasion? The next chapter in this storied rivalry is about to be written, and it promises to be a thriller for the ages.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20 World Cup:<br />\n<br />\nIn the five matches contested between the two, India Slightly edge over Aussies with three to two wins. In overall T20Is, India has dominated Australia with 19 wins to 11 losses.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (1)_1719214793.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nDid You Know?<br />\n<br />\nThe last time Australia knocked India out of the World cup was in 2012 while the last time India knocked out Australia was in 2016, both of this occasions West Indies went on to win the T20 World Cup. They defeated Australia in 2012 semi finals while defeated India in 2016 semi finals.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>India, Australia and Their T20 World Cup Nostalgia:<br />\n<br />\nThe first encounter between India and Australia in the T20 World Cup came in the semi-finals of the 2007 tournament. Yuvraj Singh&#39;s explosive innings of 70 runs off just 30 balls, including five fours and six sixes, helped India post a formidable total of 188/5. Sreesanth&#39;s fearsome bowling spell of 2/12 in his four overs then helped India outplay Australia by 15 runs, eventually leading them to win the inaugural T20 World Cup.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Another memorable encounter came in the Super 8 stage of the 2012 T20 World Cup, where Shane Watson single-handedly decimated the Indians with his all-round brilliance. He took three wickets to restrict India to 140/7 and then went berserk with the bat, scoring 72 runs off 42 balls to help Australia chase the target in just 15 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>The next special encounter was a virtual quarter-final between the two teams in the 2016 T20 World Cup. In this winner-take-all contest, Virat Kohli&#39;s masterclass performance stood out. Coming to bat when the stakes were high, Kohli scored an unbeaten 82 off 51 balls on a tough pitch, knocking Australia out of the contest. His innings is remembered as one of the best in the history of T20 World Cups.</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Decoding The Bumrah&#39;s Masterclass:<br />\n<br />\nJasprit Bumrah has been brilliant with the ball, picking up 10 wickets in as many as five games at an impressive average of 6.50 and a phenomenal economy rate of 3.42. His economy rate is the best for a bowler in a World Cup season with a minimum of 100 balls bowled. His bowling has been key to the Indian team&rsquo;s success in this tournament.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Blue and Orange Stats Instagram Story_1719237531.png\" style=\"width:440px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS: <span style=\"color:#16a085\">Australia Won the Toss and Elected to Field</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Mitchell Marsh | Australia Skipper:&quot;We will bowl first.

We have found ourselves in this situation many times in this World Cup with our backs against the wall, but we understand the pressure situation.We have a great experienced group and have enjoyed the Caribbean.

It was a spectacle at St. Lucia, where despite a hiccup after the coin toss, the Men in Blue batted with a ferocity that set the stage ablaze. The captain, Rohit Sharma, was the maestro of the innings, hammering a whirlwind 92 off just 41 deliveries, steering India to a daunting 205/5.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Aussies, in response, showed a spark with Marsh and Head stitching together a partnership that had promise. But then came the twist in the tale &ndash; India&rsquo;s bowlers, with Kuldeep leading the charge, turned the tide. A boundary catch that&rsquo;ll be etched in memories for ages by Axar, and crucial wickets including the big fish, Maxwell, swung the momentum India&rsquo;s way.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Arshdeep&rsquo;s lethal spell sent the middle order packing, and Bumrah&rsquo;s precision choked the Aussie chase. With a mountain to climb in the last over, Pandya&rsquo;s guile ensured Australia fell short, mustering only four runs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, Australia&rsquo;s fate hangs by a slender thread, while India strides with swagger into the semis, setting up a titanic clash with England. This isn&rsquo;t just a win; it&rsquo;s a statement &ndash; India&rsquo;s unwavering spirit and prowess have shone through, proving their mettle on the world stage.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Mitchell Marsh | Australia Skipper:&quot;It&#39;s disappointing. We still have a chance technically of making it to the semi-finals, but India outplayed us today.India are a better team. Rohit Sharma is a world-class player, and we&#39;ve seen that for the past 15 years. He took the game away from us at the start.There&#39;s more belief in the dressing room. In a run chase like that, you have to keep yourselves in the game and take it deep. But India were strong in the end with the ball.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match: Rohit Sharma</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:&quot;It&#39;s quite satisfying, especially when you are playing like that. We know Australia quite well. Overall, as a team, we played well and kept doing the things that we are supposed to do.200 is a good score, but when you&#39;re playing on a ground like this where wind is a big factor, anything is possible. We used the conditions well. You need to understand what needs to be done as individuals. Whoever steps up needs to do their job. It is pleasing to see how we were going through the overs and taking wickets as well.We understand the strength Kuldeep has. The New York wickets were seamer-friendly, and unfortunately, he had to miss out. He has come here and done the job for us in the last two games. That&#39;s what I am looking for from the team: everyone playing their role perfectly.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n",

This will be the fifth pair of teams to play multiple T20 World Cup semi-finals against each other.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India enters the contest riding high on confidence after impressive performances in the tournament, comfortably winning all their fixtures. They have shown resistance, grit, and determination throughout the tournament, with vital contributions from all team members in different in-game situations. Rohit Sharma showcased his class, leading from the front against Australia with a scintillating 41-ball 92, including 15 boundaries. If Rohit was the protagonist in that victory, Kuldeep Yadav backed his captain up with an excellent spell of 2/24 in a high-scoring affair. Jasprit Bumrah&#39;s performances in the tournament have been world class, with a flurry of wicket-taking deliveries while showcasing his ability to control runs. This dominant Indian side will look to continue their winning run with a mix of caution and aggression.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>England, the defending champions, enter the fray rejuvenated by their journey so far in the Super Eight. From being on the brink of elimination after a washout and a loss to Australia to facing India in the semi-finals, their journey has been remarkable. England are not only the Defending Champions but also the Champions of the last T20 World Cup held in the Caribbean. Adil Rashid and Jofra Archer have been their standout bowlers picking up 9 wickets each, while Chris Jordan was impressive in the last game, securing a hat-trick: the first England bowler to achieve this feat in this format. The English batting unit has been bolstered by Jos Butler and Phil Salt, with both doing the bulk of the scoring with 191 and 183 runs, respectively.<br />\n<br />\nThe stakes are high for this big clash. Will it be Dejavu for England in the semifinal with the goal of retaining their status as T20 World Champions or Will India avenge their 2022 loss and reach their second consecutive ICC event final? Who will come out on top in this epic clash?<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20Is:</strong><br />\nWhen it comes to head-to-head battles, India and England have always been fierce competitors. Out of 23 games contested between the two teams, India holds a slight edge with 12 wins to England&#39;s 11. In T20 World Cup history, both teams have faced each other four times, each winning two games.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (2)_1719477166.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India, England and their Consistent Run:</strong></p>\n\n<p>India and England have been consistent performers in recent times, qualifying for the knock-outs in five of the last six ICC white-ball tournaments.

However, the decision didn&#39;t pan out as expected. India, despite losing Virat Kohli early for a modest nine runs, found their hero in Rohit Sharma, who anchored the innings with a pivotal half-century. Suryakumar Yadav contributed a brisk 47 from 36 balls, while Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja added quickfire scores of 23 and 17*, respectively, pushing India to a fighting total of 171/7. England&#39;s response was aggressive from the outset, with Jos Buttler charging the Indian pacers, but the momentum shifted when Axar Patel dismissed him for 23. The introduction of Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav further tightened India&#39;s grip on the match. Axar was particularly effective, claiming crucial wickets, while Kuldeep snagged three wickets, ending with impressive figures of 3/19. Harry Brook tried to rally with 25 runs, but a costly mix-up with Jofra Archer cut short Liam Livingstone&#39;s promising innings. Despite Archer&#39;s late hitting, the English side couldn&#39;t overcome the disciplined Indian bowling, and the match concluded with India securing a solid victory. And this victory makes it to their 3rd final of ICC T20 World Cup. The Men in Blue&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/blue_heart.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> will now face South Africa in the grand finale in Barbados on Saturday (June 29). It is fitting that the two undefeated sides will meet in the final of a World Cup.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>AXAR PATEL (MAN OF THE MATCH) <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/trophy.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> :&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve often taken on the role of bowling during the powerplay, and that was our strategy going into the game. Recognizing the assistance the pitch provided for spin and its tendency to halt the ball, I aimed for simplicity in my execution. The pitch was slow, and it was clear that it would be challenging for the batters to score freely. Based on that, I adjusted my pace to be a bit slower today, and fortunately, it paid off. Our batsmen had pointed out the difficulty in hitting on this wicket, noting that some deliveries were staying low and skidding. Given this, we were confident that setting a target above 150 would be competitive. The partnership between Rohit and Suryakumar was crucial. They managed to hit the boundary when needed and kept the scoreboard ticking with smart rotations of the strike. As for this Player of the Match award, I&#39;m focusing on celebrating this achievement in the knockout stages first, without getting ahead of myself about the final in Barbados.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>ROHIT SHARMA (INDIA CAPTAIN):&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s incredibly satisfying to come away with a win today. The team has put in a lot of hard work, and I&#39;m proud of how everyone stepped up. We adjusted superbly to the conditions, which were far from easy, and that adaptability has been crucial to our success so far. Originally, we thought 140-150 runs might be enough, but during the middle overs, SKY and I picked up the pace, aiming for an extra 20-25 runs. I wanted to ensure our batsmen could play freely, based on their instincts. Eventually, setting a target of 175 turned out to be excellent given the circumstances. Our bowlers were outstanding. Axar and Kuldeep, our lead spinners, made it very challenging for the batsmen in these conditions, to maintain their composure under pressure. After the first innings, we focused on keeping the stumps in play, and they executed this perfectly. Regarding Virat Kohli, his class is undeniable. With his extensive experience, form is never a concern, and he might just be saving his best for the final. As a team, we&#39;ve maintained our composure, which is essential for making sound decisions during crucial moments like today. The final is a significant occasion, but staying composed will be key to our success. We haven&#39;t won an ICC trophy since 2013, but we are in good form and hopeful about putting on a strong performance in the finals.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>JOS BUTTLER(ENGLAND CAPTAIN):&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Today, India was simply the better team. We allowed them a few too many runs towards the end, which set us back on a challenging pitch. It&#39;s a different scenario from two years ago, and full credit to India&mdash;they fully deserved this victory. Regarding the toss decision, considering the weather conditions, I didn&#39;t anticipate much change in the playing conditions, which proved true. However, India&#39;s bowling was superior. In hindsight, perhaps we should have utilized Moeen Ali more, given how effective spin proved to be. Though we ended up chasing a target that was quite tough, I&#39;m proud of the effort everyone put in throughout this competition. We&#39;ve faced significant challenges and shown some excellent cricket at times.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The scene at Kensington Oval is electric, with the Indian squad overwhelmed with joyous tears. Rohit Sharma has steered his team out of a decade-long trophy drought, leading an unbeaten campaign. The spotlight also shines brightly on Hardik Pandya. This victory brings an ICC trophy back to Indian shores. The crowd stands in ovation, recognizing the intense battle on the field. Virat Kohli&#39;s crucial innings and Jasprit Bumrah&#39;s game-changing spells were pivotal, while Arshdeep Singh&#39;s composed 19th over finally redeemed his past oversights.

Kohli steadied the innings following early dismissals of Rohit and Rishabh, crafting a masterful knock that proved vital in the match&#39;s outcome. Contributions from Shivam Dube and Axar Patel also bolstered the Indian score. In response, South Africa faltered early with Hendricks and Markram succumbing to Bumrah and Arshdeep&#39;s swing and pace respectively. Stubbs countered effectively, propelling the Proteas post-powerplay, though his effort was short-lived. The real momentum shift came through de Kock and Klaasen; Klaasen was particularly aggressive, smashing a rapid 23-ball fifty. With the game seemingly tilting in South Africa&#39;s favor, needing 30 runs from the final five overs, India&#39;s bowlers staged a remarkable comeback. Hardik Pandya dismissed Klaasen, Bumrah claimed Jansen, and Arshdeep Singh bowled an economical penultimate over. Hardik then sealed the deal, defending the totals skillfully in the final over to clinch a 7-run victory for India.</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>India has joined the elite ranks of West Indies (2012 and 2016) and England (2010 and 2022) by securing their second T20 World Cup title in 2024, having first triumphed in 2007. Remarkably, this victory marks only the third instance in T20 World Cup history where a team has successfully defended a total in the final. India&#39;s squad replicated their 2007 feat this year, a distinction they share with West Indies, who accomplished this in 2012.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Virat Kohli, Player of the Match: &quot;This was my final T20 World Cup, and it was about now or never. Stepping up when it truly counted in my last T20I for India, that&rsquo;s what I wanted. I&rsquo;m deeply grateful&mdash;God has been kind. Yes, it wasn&rsquo;t a secret. I had made it clear this was my last T20I World Cup outing. This was my last T20 game playing for Indian team</strong></span>.&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We have many talented young players ready to take India forward. It&#39;s been a prolonged wait to secure another ICC title, not just for me but for Rohit too. He&#39;s competed in nine T20 World Cups and truly deserved this victory, as did the rest of our team. The resilience and character displayed by the team were phenomenal. Once the emotions settle, my overwhelming feeling will be gratitude for this incredible journey.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jasprit Bumrah, Player of the Tournament: &quot;I&#39;m usually the one keeping my emotions in control, focusing on the task at hand, but today, I&#39;m at a loss for words. I don&#39;t normally cry after a match, but the emotions are just overwhelming. We were in a tough spot, and to come back and win from there, with my family in the stands, is just indescribable. We came close last time, and now, having played my part in clinching this victory, there&#39;s no better feeling. Throughout the tournament, I kept myself focused, stayed in my bubble, not thinking too far ahead. When the big day came, I knew I just had to deliver. I focus on one ball, one over at a time, trying not to let emotions get the best of me. But now that it&#39;s over, it&#39;s time to let those emotions out, to scream and shout. When asked to bowl the crucial 16th over, noticing the ball was slightly scuffed, I knew it might reverse. I strategized on the toughest shots for the batter and executed my plans perfectly.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Aiden Markram (South Africa Captain): &quot;Certainly, it&#39;s tough to swallow right now. We&#39;ll need some time to process this. Nonetheless, I&#39;m immensely proud of the team&#39;s effort throughout the tournament. Our bowling performance was commendable given the tough pitch conditions. We managed to limit India to a chaseable score. Though it&#39;s disappointing not to clinch the win, I&#39;m full of pride for our squad&#39;s resilience. Throughout this tournament, we&#39;ve seen how quickly the dynamics of a game can shift. We never took our position for granted, aware that the outcome could swing at any moment. We believed we were in a prime position to take home the trophy, but fate had other plans. Looking forward, I&#39;m optimistic. One thing&#39;s for sure: the South African team will always fight fiercely and stay competitive to the very end. Despite the setback, today remains a moment of pride for us all.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma (India Captain): &quot;It&#39;s difficult to encapsulate everything we&#39;ve experienced over the past few years. We&#39;ve dedicated immense effort both individually and as a team. The preparation and strategic planning aren&#39;t just about today but reflect a sustained effort over time. When the stakes were high, everyone understood their roles and performed under pressure. Even when momentum seemed to favour South Africa, we managed to stay composed. Winning a tournament involves a lot of behind-the-scenes effort. Throughout this tournament, our performance was exceptional. Regarding Virat Kohli, his consistent excellence over the last 15 years meant that we were confident he would deliver in crucial moments. Today, he anchored our innings brilliantly, allowing others to build around him. Axar&#39;s batting was pivotal in boosting our score to a competitive total. Jasprit Bumrah&rsquo;s contribution is hard to summarize; his ability to consistently deliver under pressure is nothing short of remarkable. I&rsquo;m immensely proud of this team. The support from our fans has been overwhelming, from those here in Barbados to the millions back home staying up late to support us. Their energy fuels our passion and commitment on the field.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Team India is scheduled to face Zimbabwe in a 5-match T20 series, with Sikandar Raza captaining the opposing team. Following the retirements of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Ravindra Jadeja, the team is entering a transition phase, offering young and promising talents like Riyan Parag, Harshit Rana, Abhishek Sharma, and others the opportunity to display their skills in the blue jersey.

Although the average score at Harare in the last 10-12 games has been around 150, that total likely won&#39;t be sufficient on this pitch.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India has won the toss and has elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;first</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shubman Gill, Indian Skipper: &quot;We will bowl first. The pitch seems favourable, and it should remain consistent throughout the game. This victory has been a long time coming; winning an ICC event after 11 years is a significant achievement. There are always expectations you set for yourself. We have three players making their debuts today: Sharma, Jurel, and Parag.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sikandar Raza, Zimbabwe Skipper: &quot;I don&#39;t mind batting first. The pitch looks favourable. Zimbabwe Cricket has entrusted me with guiding the team through this transition phase. I expect the young players to step up and show their determination. It&#39;s an honour to lead this group. With Sean&#39;s retirement, we have a young squad, and Ervine will play a significant role in the future.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

By the halfway mark, we had lost 5 wickets. It would have been ideal if I had stayed till the end, so I am very disappointed with how I got out and how the rest of the match unfolded.

We need to take it one game at a time because the job is not done and the series is not over. World champions play like world champions, so we need to be ready for the next game. This isn&#39;t a wicket where you get bowled out for 115, so credit to the bowlers of both sides. It&#39;s clearly an indication that we need to up our skills. I said I don&#39;t care about the result as long as we stay true to the crowd and the changing room. We had our plans, we stuck to them, and we backed our guys. Our catching and ground fielding were amazing, but we did make some errors, which shows there&#39;s room for improvement. We knew the fans would lift us up and give us energy, and credit to them&mdash;it really helped us.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen, we&#39;re poised for a cracker of a contest at Harare Sports Club! The five-match T20I series between India and Zimbabwe hangs in the balance at 1-1, setting the stage for a pivotal third encounter.After a shock upset in the opener, the Men in Blue roared back with a clinical 100-run demolition job. Now, with the series on a knife-edge, both sides are pulling out all the stops.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s camp is buzzing with the return of their T20 World Cup heroes - the explosive Yashasvi Jaiswal, the dynamic Sanju Samson, and the hard-hitting Shivam Dube. Skipper Shubman Gill finds himself in the enviable position of having to juggle a star-studded lineup. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe&#39;s talismanic leader Sikandar Raza is rallying his troops, determined to recapture their early series magic.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Indian think tank faces some delicious dilemmas. Will we see Jaiswal unleashed at the top, reshuffling the batting order? Samson&#39;s likely to don the gloves, adding his wealth of experience behind the stumps. And let&#39;s not forget Dube - a genuine game-changer with both bat and ball.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Zimbabwe, however, are grappling with consistency woes. The promising duo of Wessly Madhevere and Brian Bennett have shown glimpses of brilliance, but the hosts desperately need a collective effort to topple the Indian juggernaut. Their bowling unit, after being taken to the cleaners last time out, must channel the spirit of their opening match heroics.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Casting our minds back to the previous encounter, it was a masterclass from India. Abhishek Sharma and Ruturaj Gaikwad put on a batting clinic, their 137-run partnership forming the backbone of India&#39;s mammoth 234/2. Abhishek&#39;s scintillating century was the highlight, while Gaikwad&#39;s composed fifty provided the perfect foil.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Zimbabwe&#39;s reply, sadly, never got out of first gear.India&#39;s bowlers had a field day, with Mukesh Kumar and Avesh Khan landing the knockout blows, ably supported by the spin duo of Ravi Bishnoi and Washington Sundar.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As we look ahead to this crucial fixture, India&#39;s reinforcements add an extra layer of intrigue. Will they stick with the winning combination or unleash their returning stars?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who will seize the momentum in this seesaw battle? Will it be India&#39;s firepower or Zimbabwe&#39;s home advantage that proves decisive? The anticipation is palpable as we count down to what promises to be a humdinger at Harare Sports Club. Buckle up - we&#39;re in for a treat!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shubman Gill | India Captain: &quot;We will bat first. Looks like a good wicket, no moisture, so that&#39;s why.We have got three World Cup winners back in the team: Sanju Samson, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Shivam Dube. We are rotating our pacers, so Mukesh has been rested. Khaleel Ahmed is in.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza | Zimbabwe Captain: &quot;We were going to bowl first anyway. A couple of changes for us. Richard Ngarava has been deemed fit and is back in the XI. Innocent Kaia, who split his webbing in the previous game, is out of the XI.

India, led by the dynamic Shubman Gill, secured a 23-run victory over Zimbabwe in the third match, taking a 2-1 lead in the series. Opting to bat first, India posted 182/4, thanks to Gill&#39;s stellar 66 off 49 balls and Ruturaj Gaikwad&#39;s explosive 49 off 28 balls. Yashasvi Jaiswal contributed 36 off 27 balls, with late cameo from Sanju Samson. Zimbabwe&#39;s bowlers Blessing Muzarabani and Sikandar Raza took 2 wickets each but faced resistance from the Indian batsmen. Chasing 183, Zimbabwe&#39;s top order crumbled to 39/5, but Dion Myers&#39; unbeaten 65 off 49 balls showed resilience. Clive Madande and Wellington Masakadza added support, but it was insufficient as they ended at 159/6. Washington Sundar starred with the ball, claiming 3 wickets for 15 runs, supported by Avesh Khan&#39;s 2 wickets and Khaleel Ahmed&#39;s economical spell. Key moments included Gill and Gaikwad&#39;s 72-run partnership and Sundar&#39;s crucial breakthroughs. India&#39;s comprehensive performance leaves Zimbabwe needing a strong comeback in the next match. Stay tuned as the series heats up!&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza| Zimbabwe Captain:&quot;Yeah, I think it&#39;s our fielding again. We pride ourselves on our fielding, but the wheels have come off in the last few games. If we had fielded well, we would have been in the game. We also have issues at the top of the order that need fixing.Unfortunately, we&#39;ve tried 15 different opening pairs, but nothing has clicked. It&#39;s time for the players, myself included, to step up and take responsibility. I can understand mistakes from youngsters, but some of us have played over 40 T20Is, and we need to shoulder the responsibility.I&#39;m an option for the top order, but we also need some experience in the middle order. This is the best team we have, and we need to back them&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match - Washington Sundar</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Washington Sundar :&quot;Feels amazing. To perform for the country is always special. Yes, it feels amazing. It was definitely a better wicket today. In the first two matches, there was something in it for the bowlers. Today, it was much better for batting. Zimbabwe did put a bit of pressure on us. That partnership between Myers and Madande put some pressure on us, but we are happy to go over the line. We have plenty of places to visit here in Zimbabwe. Hopefully, we finish the series on Saturday.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill | India Captain:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Feels good going 2-1 up in the series. It was a crucial game for us. Yeah, definitely, it looked like we would go over 200. It was not easy to hit the length ball, and that&#39;s what Ruturaj and I were discussing in the middle. That was the message we gave to our bowlers, and they executed it perfectly.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Everyone is contributing, from the openers to the bowlers. It makes the job easier.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>In the penultimate clash of the T20I series at Harare Sports Club, India looks to seal the series, leading 2-1 against Zimbabwe. After an unexpected hiccup in the opener, India bounced back with two emphatic victories, flexing their cricketing muscle and depth. The return of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, and Shivam Dube from the T20 World Cup squad has added firepower to the team. Skipper Shubman Gill has been a rock at the top, and the middle order has fired on all cylinders, making India a formidable opponent. In the last game, India posted a competitive 182/4, thanks to solid contributions from Gill, Jaiswal, and a brisk cameo by Samson. Despite being a bit of a circus in the field, Zimbabwe managed to recover from a dismal 39/5 to 159/6, with Dion Myers and Clive Madande putting on a brave 77-run stand. However, their performance still fell short, with glaring fielding and batting inconsistencies. As we gear up for the fourth T20I, Zimbabwe faces a must-win scenario. They must sharpen their fielding and deliver a cohesive performance to stay in the hunt. India, brimming with confidence, aims to wrap up the series. With a pitch likely to favour spinners, expect some fireworks. Will Zimbabwe level the series and keep the dream alive, or will India crush their hopes? Buckle up, fans, for an epic showdown!<br />\n<br />\nHead to Head :</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (7)_1720865161.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tino Mawoyo and Abhinav Mukund: &quot;Today&#39;s game will be played on a fresh pitch.

One boundary is quite short, measuring in the 60s, while the opposite side is longer, around the 80s. Indian pacers, known for their skiddy nature, have been effective at hitting the good length. Conversely, Zimbabwe&#39;s taller bowlers can exploit fuller lengths and generate bounce. Spinners will also find some assistance. Although Zimbabwe has started to read Bishnoi and Sundar better as the series has progressed, there&rsquo;s still a lot of work ahead. This looks like the best pitch of the series so far.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS:</strong> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>INDIA WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill (India Captain):</strong></span> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first. The pitch seems fresh and from what the groundsmen mentioned, it&rsquo;s been watered and should offer something for the fast bowlers. There are areas we need to improve, particularly in controlling the runs during the death overs. We got a bit complacent last time, so we&#39;ll be focusing on tightening up in that aspect. Tushar makes his debut.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza (Zimbabwe Captain): &quot;Our plan was to bat first today. Although the pitch is fresh, it tends to slow down later on in this region, so batting first seemed ideal. We&#39;re building towards our vision for 2026, and it&#39;s fantastic to have India here giving our players valuable game time. I&#39;m hopeful our top three will make a strong start today. We need all three departments to perform well. If we can achieve that, we stand a good chance. After two tough games, I believe the team is eager and ready to bounce back.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1 - 6 Overs) :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">ZIM - 44/0 (7.34 rpo, 6x4, 0x6)&nbsp;</span> ll<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&nbsp; </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 61/0 (10.16 rpo, 10x4, 0x6)</span><br />\n<br />\nMiddle Overs (7 - 15 Overs) :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">ZIM - 54/4 (6 rpo, 2x4, 1x6)&nbsp;</span> ll&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 90/0 (10 rpo, 8x4, 4x6)</span><br />\n<br />\nDeath Overs (16 - 20 Overs) :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">ZIM - 54/3 (10.8 rpo, 2x4, 2x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ll&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 5/0 in 0.2 overs (15 rpo, 1x4, 0x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The young Indian squad has proven too formidable for the Sikandar Raza-led Zimbabwe team, dominating the match comprehensively. Shubman Gill, continuing his winning streak at the toss, chose to bowl first on a fresh pitch. Tushar Deshpande, making his debut, and Khaleel Ahmed struggled initially with the new ball as Tadiwanashe Marumani and Wessly Madhevere forged a 63-run partnership for the first wicket. However, India&#39;s fifth and sixth bowlers, Abhishek Sharma and Shivam Dube, dismissed Marumani (32 off 31) and Madhevere (25 off 24) in consecutive overs, bringing India back into the contest. Zimbabwe lost momentum as wickets fell steadily. Nevertheless, skipper Sikandar Raza opted for an aggressive approach, scoring 46 off 28 balls, Once Raza was dismissed in the 19th over, India restricted Zimbabwe to 152/7 on a promising batting surface. Khaleel Ahmed rebounded effectively in the death overs, finishing with figures of 2/32. Tushar Deshpande claimed his first international wicket by dismissing the key player, Raza. Sundar, Abhishek, and Dube each took a wicket, while Bishnoi remained wicketless for the second game in a row. In response, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill launched a relentless assault on the Zimbabwean bowlers, forging an unbroken 156-run partnership. Jaiswal was the more aggressive, scoring 93 off 53 balls with 13 fours and 2 sixes. Gill, after a cautious start, found his rhythm and notched up his second consecutive fifty of the series, remaining unbeaten on 58 off 39 balls with 5 fours and 2 sixes. Zimbabwe&#39;s six bowlers were unable to break through and were thoroughly outplayed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza (Zimbabwe Captain): &quot;I believe the pitch was a bit on the slower side at the start, perhaps slightly damp. We aimed for a total around 160, which we thought would be competitive, but credit where it&#39;s due &ndash; their batting was exceptional today. Even 180 might not have been sufficient. Today, we must acknowledge that they outplayed us with the bat. We aim to come back stronger in the final game of the series. We need to improve in all three areas of the game. Even if we end the series at 2-3, it would still be a respectable outcome.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Yashasvi Jaiswal (Player of the Match): &quot;I thoroughly enjoyed today. The pitch was favourable, and I had specific plans for each bowler which made my batting experience enjoyable. When the ball was new, it came onto the bat nicely. But as it aged, it slowed down. I adjusted my approach accordingly. Shubman and I have great chemistry while batting together. Initially, I aimed to go hard in the first 10 overs, but after spending some time in the middle, I understood how to adapt and stay unbeaten till the end to secure the win for our team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill (India Captain): &quot;I&rsquo;m thrilled with my first series win as captain, but the job isn&rsquo;t finished yet. We still have one more game to play. Chasing was a key focus for us, and it&#39;s great to have accomplished that. This team is fantastic, a wonderful group of players. I hope we can continue to progress together. I haven&rsquo;t had a discussion with the coach about any changes yet, but if there are any, I&rsquo;ll update you at the toss.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India is all set for a rapid turnaround as they gear up for the fifth and final T20I against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club on Sunday, July 14. After a shocking loss in the series opener, the Shubman Gill-led Indian team has bounced back with a vengeance, winning the next three games to secure a 3-1 lead in the five-match series.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The latest victory was particularly emphatic, as India steamrolled Zimbabwe by 10 wickets, marking their dominance in the shortest format. Gill&#39;s impeccable record at the toss continued as he opted to bowl first in the fourth game. The Zimbabwean openers, Wessly Madhvere and Tadiwanashe Marumani, provided a sturdy start, but the middle order crumbled under pressure. Despite a valiant 46-run effort from Sikandar Raza, the hosts could only muster 152/7 in their 20 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tushar Deshpande, playing his debut series, redeemed himself with the crucial wicket of Raza after a shaky start. Khaleel Ahmed shone in the death overs, claiming two wickets, while Abhishek Sharma and Shivam Dube also chipped in with vital breakthroughs. Washington Sundar continued his consistent performance, and despite going wicketless, Ravi Bishnoi made an impact with his fielding prowess.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s chase was a masterclass in batting. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill dismantled the Zimbabwean bowling attack with ease, guiding their team to victory in just 16 overs. Jaiswal&#39;s explosive 53-ball 93 and Gill&#39;s elegant 39-ball 58 ensured India reached the target without losing a wicket.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Looking ahead to the final game, India is expected to rotate their squad, possibly giving a chance to some new faces. The aim will be to finish the series on a high note with a 4-1 victory. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, will be playing for pride, hoping to salvage a win and end the series on a positive note.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Will India maintain their dominance, or can Zimbabwe pull off an upset in the final match?<br />\n<br />\nToss:- <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Zimbabwe have won the toss and opted to bowl first.<br />\n<br />\nSikandar Raza: &quot;We&#39;re going to bowl first. The pitch tends to improve, so it should be better for batting in the second innings. We have the motivation, confidence, and skills needed. Chatara has been rested for this match&quot;.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shubman Gill: &quot;We were planning to bat first anyway. Our spinners have performed well, and the fast bowlers have been economical. The players are hungry and eager to play. It&#39;s challenging to play back-to-back matches. We have a couple of changes today - Mukesh Kumar and Parag are coming in.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Sanju Samson stepped up when it mattered most, scoring a composed 58 off 45 balls. He was well-supported by Riyan Parag and Shivam Dube, who contributed 22 and 26 runs respectively, propelling India to a strong total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Zimbabwe struggled against India&#39;s bowling attack. Mukesh Kumar was the standout performer, claiming four crucial wickets. Despite an important 34-run knock from Myers and a late cameo from Faraz Akram, Zimbabwe fell short, managing only 125 runs before being bowled out. Shivam Dube also chipped in with two key wickets, ensuring India&#39;s dominance throughout the match.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This comprehensive win not only secured the series for India but also showcased the depth and resilience of their squad<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shivam Dube- Player of the Match: &quot;Contributing in both batting and bowling is always special. Taking wickets felt great. T20s can be challenging, but one good shot can turn things around. The ground here is big, and we love playing in this amazing atmosphere with such fantastic people.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nWashington Sundar- Player of the Series: &quot;It&#39;s great to finish with a win. After the first game, we noticed conditions were similar to South Africa, with extra bounce and pace. We had plenty of time to gather insights. There are many takeaways and learnings from this series, and I got to bowl a lot. Our team had a lot of success together.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sikandar Raza: &quot;Blessing bowled excellently throughout the series. However, our batting fell short. What stands out for me is our fielding attitude, which we can improve. Richie wasn&rsquo;t fit at the beginning, so having him fit now is fantastic. It&#39;s great to see Richie and Blessing working well together. I need to manage my workload, so I&#39;ll head back to play domestic cricket. I&#39;m still available for Test matches, and I leave for the Hundred in a few days.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill: &quot;It&rsquo;s been an excellent series. The hunger and determination we showed after the first loss were phenomenal. Many of the players had long flights and were not used to the conditions, but their adaptation was remarkable. I&#39;ve been to Sri Lanka once for the Asia Cup, and I&#39;m looking forward to going there again and performing well&quot;.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

However, they will start this series with a new captain and coach, Surya Kumar Yadav and Gautam Gambhir, respectively. With veterans Kohli, Rohit, and Jadeja bidding farewell to the format, the onus now falls on Pant, Hardik, and Surya to lead the charge. These players have a knack for winning matches and will be eager to carry their form forward. Bumrah has been rested for the series to manage his workload.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Sri Lanka, on the other hand, come into the series after a disappointing T20 World Cup. They, too, have&nbsp;undergone changes in</strong>&nbsp;<strong>coaching and captaincy. Sanath Jayasuriya will serve as their interim coach, while the cool-headed Asalanka, who recently led Jaffna to a title triumph, is set to captain the team. Sri Lanka has added the experienced Chandimal and Perera to their squad for this series and will be looking to start on a positive note.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>With both teams featuring new-look squads and the stakes sky-high, which team will emerge on top? Fans are eagerly anticipating a competitive and entertaining series.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20Is:</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn as many as 29 games battled between the two teams, India dominated the contest with 19 wins to Sri Lanka&#39;s 9 wins while one game ended in no result..<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (8)_1722083650.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Pitch Report :&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;There&#39;s a cool breeze blowing across the ground, which will bring the temperature down. The surface is hard with some visible cracks.<br />\nCompared to the LPL surface, this one looks quite different, with more cracks. As the ball loses its hardness, it will tend to stick in the surface. However, it should still be good for batting, and we can expect plenty of runs here.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Toss:-<br />\nThe Coin has Spun in the Lankan&#39;s Favour as they have decided to&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;first.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000cc\">Charith Asalanka:-&nbsp;&quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first as the pitch looks promising, and we want to assess its behavior. We&#39;re opting for a 6-5 combination of batters and bowlers. Each player has a specific role, which is why we&#39;ve chosen to go with 5 bowlers. You can look forward to more wins and consistent performances from our team.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav:-&quot;The pitch looks good, so we&#39;re fine with batting first. Our brand of cricket remains unchanged. The relationship between me and Gambhir has been special for many years. Dube, Samson, Khaleel, and Washington are the four players missing out today. The World Cup is behind us; we&#39;re starting fresh, and this is a new challenge.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1 - 6 Overs) :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 74/1 (12.34 rpo, 11x4, 3x6)&nbsp; </span>ll<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp; </span><span style=\"color:#0000cc\">SL - 55/0 (9.16 rpo, 7x4, 2x6)</span><br />\n<br />\nMiddle Overs (7 - 15 Overs) :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 85/2 (9.44 rpo, 9x4, 2x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ll<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp; </span><span style=\"color:#0000cc\">SL - 94/3 (10.44 rpo, 10x4, 3x6)</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Death Overs (16 - 20 Overs) :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 54/4 (10.8 rpo, 7x4, 2x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ll<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp; </span><span style=\"color:#0000cc\">SL - 21/7 in 4.2 overs (4.85 rpo, 2x4, 0x6)</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India kicked off the series with a commanding 43-run victory over Sri Lanka, taking a 1-0 lead. Put into bat first, India set an imposing total of 213 for 7 in their 20 overs. The opening duo of Gill and Jaiswal got India off to a flying start, punishing the Sri Lankan bowlers with aggressive stroke play. The highlight of the innings was Surya Kumar Yadav&#39;s composed half-century, which stabilized the innings. Pant provided a late flourish, ensuring India reached a formidable score. Pathirana was the standout bowler for Sri Lanka, claiming four wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Sri Lanka began their chase with confidence as Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis put together an 84-run opening stand. Mendis fell for a well-made 45, but Nissanka continued to anchor the innings, partnering with Perera to add another 50 runs. However, once Nissanka was dismissed, the Indian bowlers seized control. Sri Lanka&#39;s batting lineup crumbled, losing the last nine wickets for just 30 runs, ultimately falling short by 43 runs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Riyan Parag was instrumental in India&#39;s bowling attack, picking up three wickets. Arshdeep Singh and Axar Patel also contributed significantly, each taking two wickets. India&#39;s balanced performance with both bat and ball highlighted their dominance, setting the tone for the rest of the series.<br />\n<br />\nPlayer of the Match:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav (India Skipper): &quot;I believe they played a strong brand of cricket from the very first ball. Despite losing wickets, they maintained a high tempo. We had practiced here for two to three days and were well-prepared for the pitch conditions. Given that we recently won the World Cup, we never doubted our ability to stay in control. Fortunately, there was no dew to contend with&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000cc\">Charitha Asalanka (Sri Lanka Skipper): &quot;Certainly, we weren&#39;t up to the mark with the ball during the powerplay. However, we made a strong comeback, and at one point, it seemed they might reach 240. We could have performed better with the bat. The 6-5 combination is an experiment, but it&#39;s the approach we should consider for the future.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

Sri Lanka batting first, got off to a great start, with Pathum Nissanka&#39;s 32 and Kusal Perera&#39;s blistering 53 off 34 balls providing a strong foundation, after which Ravi Bishnoi shone with the ball for India claiming 3/26, supported by Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh and Hardik Pandya, who each took two wickets to pull back the momentum and restrict Sri Lanka to 161/9.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing a revised target of 78 runs in 8 overs, India came out with all guns blazing.

The Indian team has been in stupendous form with both bat and ball. Jaiswal&#39;s explosive starts and Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s versatile batting have been highlights, while Ravi Bishnoi has stood out as the leading bowler, ably supported by Arshdeep Singh and Riyan Parag. This first series under the combination of Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav has already been a success, and they will be looking to end the series on a high note.</strong><br />\n<strong>Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have struggled throughout the series, particularly their middle order, which collapsed significantly&mdash;losing nine wickets for 30 runs in the first game and seven wickets for 31 runs in the second game. However, their top order has been impressive, spearheaded by Nissanka&#39;s magnificent performances. Kusal Perera and Mendis have also shown good form with the bat. Pathirana has successfully dismissed Suryakumar Yadav in both games, and Hasaranga has taken Jaiswal&#39;s wicket in both matches. They will be keen to replicate their performances once again. Sri Lanka will be looking to change their middle-order fortunes and will eye a consolation win to end the series on a positive note.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20Is:<br />\nIn the 31 games played between the two teams, India has emerged Victorious on 21 occasions while Sri Lanka has managed to win nine games.

We&#39;re on a new pitch right next to the one used in the last two games. This surface is drier, with visible cracks, so expect a significant turn. Slower deliveries will be particularly effective here.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>There&#39;s dew on the ground, making the ball wet and causing it to slide. As a result, chasing might be the preferable option. A target of 160-170 should be competitive. The slower you bowl, the more difficult it will be for batters to play their strokes. The dew will also make it challenging to grip the ball properly.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nToss:- Sri Lanka has won the toss and opted to bowl first.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000cc\">Charith Asalanka:&nbsp;&quot;We are going to bowl first. The pitch looks dry. There was a batting collapse when the ball got older, making it harder to bat. We&#39;ve planned a bit differently this time. We have one change in the lineup, Wickramasinghe comes in for Dasun.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav:&nbsp;&quot;We would&#39;ve liked to chase as well, considering the weather. It becomes difficult for the bowling team to control the ball later. We have four players resting today - Hardik, Axar, Rishabh, and Arshdeep. We talked about the brand of cricket we want to play, and it&#39;s about improving every game and being the best version of ourselves.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Despite early setbacks, Shubman Gill (39 off 37) and Riyan Parag (26 off 18) provided some stability. The standout bowler for Sri Lanka was Maheesh Theekshana, who took 3 wickets for 28 runs. Chamindu Wickramasinghe and Wanindu Hasaranga also contributed significantly, each taking crucial wickets to keep the Indian batting lineup in check.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sri Lanka&#39;s chase saw a solid start from Kusal Mendis (43 off 41) and Kusal Perera (46 off 34), but they struggled to maintain momentum, losing wickets at critical junctures. Ravi Bishnoi and Washington Sundar were the pick of the Indian bowlers, each claiming two wickets to keep the pressure on while Rinku and Surya too contributed with two wickets. The match eventually ended in a tie, with Sri Lanka finishing at 137/8.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In the super over, India&#39;s bowlers held their nerve to secure a thrilling victory, sealing the series. This win marked a significant achievement for Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s leadership and highlighted the depth and resilience of the Indian team.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Washington Sundar | Player of the Match:<br />\n&quot;All the work I&#39;ve put in, along with blessings from God, really helped me today. I tried to stay calm throughout. I&#39;m very grateful to SKY for trusting me with the ball. It&#39;s a wonderful opportunity, and I just focused on doing what I&#39;m supposed to do. We did our homework on their batters, and I aimed to hit the right lengths.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000cc\">Charith Asalanka:&nbsp;<br />\n&quot;I am really disappointed with our batting lineup, especially the middle-order and lower middle-order. The poor shot selection was a major issue. Hasaranga was sent up the order because the spinners were bowling, and he had the license to hit a few boundaries, but it didn&#39;t work out. We made wrong shot selections on this pitch. The target was definitely achievable, and we need to perform better as professional cricketers. I want to see improved batting performances in the ODIs. Our top three and four have done well, which is the only positive for us.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav | Player of the Series:<br />\n&quot;More than the last over, I feel the real turning point was when we were 30/4. The boys showed incredible character to reach 140, which was a par score on that track. I told them that if we put our hearts into it, we could pull it off. Their skill level and self-confidence make my job easy. The positivity and care they have for each other are unbelievable. After the last game, I told a few boys they would be rested, and they were ready to sit out without hesitation. They make my job easy, and I feel little pressure when I bat. As I said before the series, I don&#39;t want to just be a captain; I want to be a leader.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Fresh off a 3-0 T20I sweep, the Men in Blue are ready to light up the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With the return of heavyweights like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, and Shreyas Iyer, India&rsquo;s lineup looks formidable. The top order, featuring Rohit and Shubman Gill, promises fireworks, while the middle order, bolstered by Iyer and Rahul, adds depth and stability. Keep an eye out for the potential debut of Riyan Parag, adding a fresh spark to the mix.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The bowling attack remains strong, with Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav leading the charge, and Harshit Rana poised for his maiden ODI appearance. Despite the gloomy weather forecast and a 78% chance of rain, the anticipation is palpable.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sri Lanka, battling injury woes, will rely on the likes of Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis to step up. But make no mistake, the spotlight is firmly on India as they aim to continue their dominance and fine-tune their squad ahead of the Champions Trophy.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head to Head</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (1)_1722589120.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

My goal was to put their bowlers under pressure. Janith and I aimed to build a partnership, and later, I had a solid partnership with Hasaranga. The wicket was slow, so we targeted a score of 220. The pitch improved slightly in the second innings. Our skipper Wanindu Hasaranga changed the game for us. Overall, we played a wonderful match today.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &nbsp;&quot;The score was gettable, but it required good batting to reach it. We batted well in patches but lacked consistent momentum. We had the upper hand, but then we lost a couple of wickets. The partnership between KL and Axar brought us back into the game. It was a bit disappointing at the end, but these things happen. Sri Lanka played well, and in the end, it was a fair result. The pitch remained the same; it wasn&#39;t one where you could just come in and play your shots&mdash;you had to dig in. The game swung back and forth between both teams. We should have managed to get that one run.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot;I did believe we could defend the total; we should have done a bit better to restrict them. The pitch turned more in the afternoon, but under lights, batting became easier. When the left-hander came in, I felt I could bowl as it was spinning a lot. I&#39;m happy with the energy we showed in the field. Dunith&#39;s knock was crucial, and Nissanka batted well.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The venue remains unchanged, but the hosts will be missing their star player, Wanindu Hasaranga, due to a hamstring injury from the previous game. The Indian team, which dominated much of the first match, aims to rectify their past errors. Meanwhile, the spirited Sri Lankan side seeks to maintain the momentum they gained in the latter stages of the first ODI.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#660000\"><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nRussell Arnold: &quot;It&#39;s a scorching afternoon, and the warm breeze adds to the heat. We&#39;ve shifted a few strips over, and the pitch looks dry, much like the one from a couple of days ago. The cracks on the surface are quite wide, indicating significant crumbling as the game progresses. The captain who wins the toss will likely choose to bat first. Batters will need to focus on finding the gaps and running hard to wear down the opposition.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Sri Lanka has won the toss and has elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot;Definitely we are batting first. The pitch appears similar to the previous match with minimal changes. Our strategy remains unchanged from the last game. Wanindu Hasaranga and Mohamed Shiraz are out, replaced by Kamindu Mendis and Jeffrey Vandersay. The previous game gave us a boost, and now we need to capitalize on that and secure a win.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &nbsp;&quot;We understand what&#39;s required when chasing, so we&#39;ve talked to the team about it. You can&#39;t always approach the game with the same mindset; you need to adjust to the conditions at hand. We&#39;ve emphasized this to the boys. It&#39;s crucial to adapt quickly and play with freedom. Staying focused on the present and what needs to be done today is important. We&#39;re going with the same XI.

While it&#39;s easy to take credit for my performance, I want to acknowledge the batters who scored 240 runs, making it easier for me to bowl in good areas. With Hasaranga, our No. 1 spinner, out, I had to adapt to the team&#39;s atmosphere and balance quickly. I need to keep pushing myself to perform well.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &nbsp;&quot;Losing a game is always painful; it&#39;s not just about those 10 overs. Consistency is key, and we didn&#39;t manage that today. While it&#39;s disappointing, these things happen. We need to adapt to the conditions in front of us. With a left-right combination, we thought it would be easier to rotate the strike&mdash;credit to Jeffrey Vandersay for his impressive six-wicket haul. </strong></span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Don&#39;t want to look too much into how we played. But there&#39;ll be talks about&nbsp;our batting in the middle overs&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot;I was quite satisfied with our score of 240, which I felt was sufficient. As a captain, having an abundance of spin options is a good problem to have. Vandersay delivered an unbelievable spell, especially considering the opposition was over 90 runs when he started bowling. My primary role is as a batter, so I focus on scoring runs first, and then I can contribute with my bowling.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Greetings and a warm welcome to the live commentary of the third and final ODI between hosts Sri Lanka and India at R Premadasa International Stadium, Colombo. The ODI series has taken an intriguing turn after a dominant display in the T20I series, where India achieved a resounding whitewash. The first match ended in a dramatic tie, while the second match saw Sri Lanka emerging victorious.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Today&#39;s match is crucial, with everyone wondering: Will India level the series with a win, or will Sri Lanka secure a trophy for their cabinet? Another point of interest is India&#39;s playing XI - will there be any changes, or will they stick with the same team?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stay tuned as we dive into this thrilling encounter.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head to Head :</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (11)_1723018850.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>One match ended in a tie between the two nations.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nRussell Arnold: &quot;The pitch is dry once again, setting the stage for a similar type of game. However, it&rsquo;s a fresh pitch, with the groundsman meticulously using scissors to remove grass. This has resulted in more visible cracks, promising not just a turn but also the occasional spiteful bounce. This will certainly present a greater challenge for the batters. To score runs here, one must adopt a patient and disciplined approach. As Robbie mentioned, you&rsquo;ve got to be boring to get runs here.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Sri Lanka has won the toss and has elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot; Definitely We are going to bat first. It looks the same as the previous two ODIs. Theekshana comes in for Akila Dananjaya. Guys are doing very well, we are in a good position. I would like to see someone score a hundred on this pitch.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &quot;Plenty to play for, and we&#39;ve been challenged in the last two matches. It&#39;s clear what we need to do with both the bat and the ball. We&#39;ve addressed it as a group. You have to give credit to the opposition; they played well and understood the situation perfectly. This is another opportunity for us to correct our course. We have two changes: Rishabh and Riyan Parag come in for KL and Arshdeep.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

Riyan Parag was the standout bowler for India, taking 3 wickets for 54 runs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, India&#39;s batting lineup crumbled, managing only 138 runs in 26.1 overs. Rohit Sharma top-scored with a quick 35 off 20 balls, but the rest of the batting order struggled against the Sri Lankan bowlers. Dunith Wellalage was particularly effective, claiming 5 wickets for just 27 runs, leading Sri Lanka to a dominant win.

Everyone gave me great support, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. We adjusted well to the wicket as it was turning, similar to the first two ODIs, and committed fewer mistakes today. The batters did a great job, and then the spinners bowled exceptionally well. Everyone is supporting each other, and I am excited to be part of this team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, India Skipper: &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a major concern, but it&#39;s something we need to address individually and within our game plan. It&#39;s a joke to think that playing for India allows any room for complacency. When I am captain, complacency is not an option. However, you have to give credit where it&#39;s due&mdash;Sri Lanka played better than us today. We assessed the conditions and chose our combinations accordingly. Some players needed to be considered, hence the changes. We have many areas that need improvement, rather than just focusing on the positives.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Charith Asalanka, Sri Lanka Skipper: &quot; I am a happy captain right now. The team did everything right throughout the series. We all knew India had a strong batting lineup, so we focused on our strength, which is spin, and we backed it fully. The team is in high spirits, and our coach, Sanath Jayasuriya, has been very active and supportive. The boys have really enjoyed the team environment.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Indian cricket team is gearing up for an intense and exciting three-month Test season, beginning with a two-match series against Bangladesh, starting on September 19, 2024, at the iconic MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. This season promises to be a grueling one for India, as they will play a total of 10 Test matches&mdash;five at home and five away. After facing Bangladesh, India will take on New Zealand in another home series, followed by a crucial five-match series against Australia down under in November and December.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bangladesh enters this contest with immense confidence, having just completed a historic series win against Pakistan on their home soil. This victory marks Bangladesh&#39;s third away Test series triumph, and it has come at a crucial time when they are still in contention for a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>The standout performers for Bangladesh in the Pakistan series were Litton Das and Mehidy Hasan Miraz, both of whom played pivotal roles while Mushfiqur Rahim&#39;s 191 in the first Tests was their key to victory. In a thrilling comeback during the second Test, Bangladesh was reduced to 26/6 in their first innings, trailing by more than 200 runs. However, Litton and Mehidy stitched together a record-breaking seventh-wicket partnership that turned the game around, ultimately leading Bangladesh to a convincing six-wicket victory.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Mehidy Hasan&rsquo;s heroics were not limited to his batting. With the ball, he claimed 10 wickets across the two games, making him the leading wicket-taker in the series for Bangladesh. He was closely followed by Hasan Mahmud, who took 8 wickets, and the young pace sensation Nahid Rana, who grabbed 6 wickets. Bangladesh&rsquo;s bowling attack, spearheaded by these players, will aim to carry this winning momentum into the series against India, with the WTC final spot still very much within reach.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India, on the other hand, returns to the international arena after a considerable break. The last time they played was in early August, and they will be keen to get back into the groove with a fresh start. India currently sits at the top of the WTC points table with 68.52 PCT in nine matches so far and has the most remaining matches (10) to play. With the stakes high, they are aiming to consolidate their position and make a strong case for the WTC final yet again.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>The pitch at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, known for assisting spinners, will likely see India fielding a spin-heavy attack. The combination of local hero Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will form the crux of India&rsquo;s bowling attack, supported by a third spinner. India may also go with two pacers to maintain a balanced lineup, with the possibility of including one of their young fast-bowling talents. The Chepauk wicket, traditionally known for its turn and variable bounce, will test both teams&rsquo; batting skills against high-quality spin.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India&rsquo;s squad is a blend of experience and youth, and the team management will likely rely on their seasoned players to lead the charge. With senior players such as Ashwin and Jadeja handling the spin department, and experienced batters like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in the middle, India will look to dominate Bangladesh from the outset.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Battle with High Stakes</strong></p>\n\n<p>With both teams eyeing the WTC final, this series promises to be a fascinating contest. Bangladesh is riding high on their recent success and will be hungry to challenge the top-ranked side. For India, this is the beginning of a crucial season, and they will aim to start it on a high note, especially with a challenging tour of Australia looming later in the year.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head-To-Head in Tests:</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn the 13 games contested between the two teams, India have clearly dominated the contest with 11 wins while other two games has been ended in a draw. Bangladesh are yet to open their win account against India so far.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (4)_1726659557.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Stats At MA Chidambaram Stadium.</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn the 34 matches played at this venue, teams batting first have won 12 times, while teams batting second have emerged victorious on 10 occasions. Eleven matches have ended in a draw, and one game resulted in a tie. Spinners have dominated at Chepauk, taking 584 wickets, while pacers have managed 381 wickets. Interestingly, only two Indian batters have scored triple centuries in Tests, and both of these remarkable feats were achieved at this ground. Notably, Virender Sehwag also has another triple century to his name, which he scored in Multan.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI( ICC 2024) Stats Temp (7)_1726661950.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pitch Report: Dinesh Karthik:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>This surface, reminiscent of the ones that saw Bedi and Prasanna weave their magic, hints at bounce and turn.

In the first innings, India posted a total of 376 runs, with significant contributions from Ravindra Jadeja (86), R. Ashwin (113), and Yashasvi Jaiswal (56). Bangladesh&#39;s bowling was led by Hasan Mahmud, who took 5 wickets. Bangladesh struggled in their first innings, being bowled out for 149, with Shakib (32) and Litton Das (22) being the top scorers.

India batted well and their seamers contributed, especially with the new ball. Like we bowled in the first innings, We need momentum and keep delivering such performances consistently.

Even though we&#39;ve been away from playing for a while, you&#39;re never truly away from cricket. We arrived a week in advance, aiming for the result we wanted. Pant has been terrific. He&rsquo;s gone through some tough phases, and the way he handled himself was incredible to watch. After returning in the IPL, followed by a strong World Cup, he&rsquo;s back in his favorite format. The key was to give him enough game time, and credit to him, he made an immediate impact. Regardless of conditions, we aim to build our team around that approach. Over the past few years, wherever we&rsquo;ve played, we&rsquo;ve ensured we had this as part of our strategy. Full credit to the players for stepping up when needed. The red-soil pitch always presents something unique, requiring patience. This was a surface where we needed to be patient with both bat and ball to keep them under pressure. Ash has been there throughout. He&rsquo;s consistently reliable with both the ball and bat. Every time he&rsquo;s involved, it&rsquo;s a joy to watch&mdash;he&rsquo;s never out of the game. He also enjoyed his time batting in the TNPL.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>R ASHWIN is Player of the Match&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>R ASHWIN: &quot;Every time I play in Chennai, it&rsquo;s an incredible experience for me. I&rsquo;ve spent so many hours in those stands watching Test cricket and international matches. I&rsquo;m probably enjoying my game now because of what I&rsquo;m doing on the field. It was a chance to fight hard and dig deep. I kept things simple and I&rsquo;m grateful to Jadeja for his support. It was a special innings, though it didn&rsquo;t really hit me until the second day. My main job is bowling&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I make a living. Batting, on the other hand, just comes naturally to me..&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

India, buoyed by their depth in Chennai despite quiet outings from Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, might bolster their spin attack by bringing in Axar Patel or Kuldeep Yadav.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As the teams take the field, all eyes will be on key battles: India&#39;s top order against Bangladesh&#39;s new ball attack, and Bangladesh&#39;s batsmen facing India&#39;s potent spin trio. While India enters as firm favorites, Bangladesh are eager to prove their mettle. With World Test Championship points at stake, this match promises to be a gripping contest, provided the weather permits.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head-To-Head in Tests:</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>In as many as 14 games battled between the two teams, India has won 12 games while Bangladesh are yet to open their win account.

The win, achieved with more than a session to spare, seemed improbable after nearly three days were lost to rain and wet outfield conditions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The match began with India winning the toss and electing to field, a rare choice for the team in home Tests. Bangladesh&#39;s first innings, interrupted by weather delays, saw Mominul Haque as the standout performer with an unbeaten century. However, his efforts were not enough to prevent the visitors from being dismissed for 233, with Jasprit Bumrah leading India&#39;s bowling attack.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s response was nothing short of extraordinary. The hosts adopted an aggressive T20-style approach in their first innings, breaking records for the fastest team totals at various stages. Rohit Sharma set the tone with three sixes as his first scoring shots, while Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul contributed quick half-centuries. India declared at 285/9 in just 34.4 overs, establishing a 52-run lead.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bangladesh&#39;s second innings crumbled under pressure from India&#39;s formidable bowling lineup. Despite resistance from Shadman Islam and Mushfiqur Rahim, the visitors were bundled out for 146. Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, and Ravichandran Ashwin shared the spoils, each claiming three wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing a modest target of 95, India lost early wickets but remained in control. Yashasvi Jaiswal once again showcased his aggressive intent, scoring a brisk 51 off 45 balls. Fittingly, Rishabh Pant hit the winning boundary, sealing India&#39;s victory.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This win solidifies India&#39;s position at the top of the World Test Championship standings and marks a successful start to Gautam Gambhir&#39;s tenure as coach. The team&#39;s ability to force a result in such time-constrained circumstances highlights their dominance in home conditions and their commitment to pursuing victory against all odds.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The match will be remembered for India&#39;s bold strategy and execution, turning what could have been a dull draw into a thrilling contest.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Yashasvi Jaiswal (Player of the Match):</span><br />\n&quot;I was just focused on what I could do for the team. The conditions in Chennai and here were different, so I adapted accordingly and gave my best. Every innings is important, and I always prepare with that mindset. Rohit bhai and Gautam sir told me to bat freely, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we aimed for&mdash;to win and play with intent.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\">Najmul Hossain Shanto (Bangladesh Captain):</span><br />\n&quot;We took early wickets but couldn&rsquo;t capitalize later. In both matches, we didn&#39;t bat well according to the conditions. Our batters got starts but didn&rsquo;t convert. Mominul&#39;s innings and Miraz&rsquo;s bowling were positives, and I hope Miraz can continue this form in future matches.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma (India Captain):</span><br />\n&quot;In life, we all move on. Rahul Bhai did a great job, and now we&rsquo;re working with Gambhir, who has a clear mindset. It&rsquo;s early, but we&rsquo;ve started well. Losing a couple of days meant we had to keep the game moving. After getting them out for 233, it wasn&rsquo;t about runs but how many overs we could bowl at them. The pitch didn&rsquo;t offer much, but the bowlers made it happen.We took a calculated risk by batting aggressively, even knowing we might get bowled out quickly. Akash Deep has the fitness and energy to bowl long spells, and it&#39;s important to have players ready when needed.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

It was pretty exciting to see them(Mayank Yadav and Nitish Reddy) perform. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to watching them excel in the upcoming games.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India and Bangladesh are all set to ignite the crowd in Delhi on October 9, 2024, for what promises to be an electrifying second T20I. Team India, riding high on the back of a <em>thrashing</em> win in the first game, will be brimming with confidence. Their chase of a modest 128 was nothing short of a <em>masterclass</em>, finishing the job with 49 balls to spare. Fans were treated to some <em>scintillating</em> shots from the flamboyant Suryakumar Yadav, while Sanju Samson&rsquo;s calm brilliance and Hardik Pandya&rsquo;s <em>blistering</em> finish had Indian supporters roaring with joy.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>But before the fireworks with the bat, it was the Indian bowlers who <em>lit up</em> the stage. Varun Chakaravarthy, returning to the fold, was <em>on fire</em> with a sensational three-wicket haul. Arshdeep Singh matched his intensity, also grabbing three crucial wickets, while debutant Mayank Yadav&rsquo;s <em>fearsome</em> spell left Bangladesh reeling.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Bangladesh, however, will be itching for <em>revenge</em>. Their performance in the first game left fans disappointed, with only Mehidy Hasan&rsquo;s fighting 35* and Najmul Hossain Shanto&rsquo;s 27 standing out. Their bowlers were left clueless against India&rsquo;s <em>onslaught</em>. But a <em>comeback</em> is on the cards, as they&rsquo;ll be looking to pull off an upset and keep the series alive before heading to Hyderabad for the third T20I.&nbsp;Who among the two will come on top?<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20Is:</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width_1728474578.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Stats at Arun Jaitley Stadium (Last five games)</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn the last five games played here at this venue, the team batting first has won all five games, while the average first-batting score is 235. This is a batting paradise, and the team winning the toss will opt to bat first. It&#39;s a high-scoring affair on the cards.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pitch Report: Abinav Mukund</strong><br />\n<br />\n&quot;The second T20 International is shaping up to be a high-scoring affair. Historically, this pitch has seen plenty of runs. It&#39;s not a particularly large ground - around 55-60m square and 70m straight. During the IPL, this pitch has consistently produced scores over 200. The surface looks hard, which could spell trouble for bowlers. We might even see scores above 200 prove insufficient. In a recent local T20 tournament, a team scored 300 runs here. Interestingly, teams batting first have a perfect record in IPL matches at this venue. While batting first seems advantageous, the presence of dew could be a factor to consider.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss</strong>: Bangladesh has won the toss and elected to field!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto:-<br />\n&quot;We would prefer to bowl first. There&#39;s a chance of dew in the second innings. The pitch looks good for batting, with high scores in previous matches. We need to focus on our strengths today. Our top order must perform well in the powerplay. We&#39;ve made one change: Sakib is replacing Shoriful in the lineup.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav:-&nbsp;<br />\n&quot;We wanted to bat first too. It&#39;s a chance to test our bowlers with a potentially wet ball. There&#39;s plenty of talent in the team. I&#39;m enjoying watching our batters perform. You need to stay ahead of the game. The pitch looks great. We&#39;re going with the same lineup as last time.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Put into bat first on Delhi&#39;s batting-friendly pitch, India posted a formidable 221/9 in their 20 overs. Nitish Reddy and Rinku Singh were the standout performers, each scoring crucial half-centuries, while Hardik Pandya provided the finishing touch with some powerful hitting at the death.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing a challenging target of 222, Bangladesh struggled to build any momentum, regularly losing wickets throughout the innings. They eventually finished at 135/9, with Mahmudullah top-scoring with 41. For India, Nitish Reddy and CV Varun picked up two wickets each, while the rest of the bowling attack chipped in with a wicket apiece, sealing the comprehensive win and the series victory for India.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\">Najmul Hossain Shanto- Bangladesh Skipper<br />\n&quot;We repeated our mistakes from the previous game, which isn&#39;t acceptable for our team. We must improve. Bowling first was the right call, I believe. Their batting picked up after the powerplay, and we struggled to stick to our plans. As batsmen, we need to step up and have more self-belief. Our bowlers performed well, but we couldn&#39;t break through in the middle overs.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Suryakumar Yadav -India Skipper<br />\n&quot;I welcomed that scenario, wanting our middle-order batsmen in that position. I&#39;m pleased with both Rinku and Nitish. They played exactly as I&#39;d hoped. It&#39;s about going out there and expressing yourself. Only the jersey changes, everything else stays the same. I was keen to see how different bowlers would handle various situations.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nNitish Kumar Reddy - Player Of The Match<br />\n&quot;It&#39;s an incredible feeling to play for India. I&#39;m proud and grateful for this opportunity. Credit goes to the captain and coach for their support. They gave me the freedom to play my game. I started cautiously, but after that no-ball, things went my way.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

It&#39;s like a cricket version of &quot;India&#39;s Got Talent,&quot; and boy, have we uncovered some gems!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Take Nitish Kumar Reddy, for instance. This lad didn&#39;t just debut; he exploded onto the scene like a bat-wielding firecracker in Delhi. And let&#39;s not forget Rinku Singh, the ultimate supporting actor who&#39;s threatening to steal the show.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Together, they propelled India to a massive 221/9 in the second match, leaving Bangladesh&#39;s bowlers feeling like they&#39;d been caught in a batting blitzkrieg. Poor Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman &ndash; they flashed moments of brilliance, but mostly looked like they were trying to stop a runaway train with a cricket bat.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, as we head into the Hyderabad humdinger, the pitch promises more fireworks than Diwali. With a par score of 171, we might need to install a scoreboard with extra digits!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sure, there&#39;s a whiff of rain in the air, but nothing can dampen Team India&#39;s spirits.So, will it be a hat-trick of wins for India? Or will Bangladesh find their roar in the eleventh hour?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Elect to Bat First&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;ve decided to bat first. The wicket looks good, and with the dew factor in mind, we want to challenge ourselves. It&#39;s fantastic to see so many supporters here, even with us leading 2-0.Maintaining the approach we&#39;ve had in the last two games is important&mdash;building strong habits is key. We&#39;re focused on allowing players to express themselves on the field. We&#39;ve made one change today: Arshdeep Singh is out, and Ravi Bishnoi comes in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto | Bangladesh Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&quot;Yes, I&rsquo;m happy to be bowling first, so the toss doesn&rsquo;t really matter. We&rsquo;ve made two changes. Mehidy Hasan is in and Jaker Ali is out. Mahedi Hasan and Tanzid Hasan come into the XI.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

With eleven fours and eight sixes, the wicketkeeper-batsman showcased his exceptional form, with a strike rate of 236.17. Not to be outdone, Captain Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s 75 off 35 balls demonstrated his T20 batting mastery, solidifying his reputation as one of the most formidable batsmen in this format.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Riyan Parag (34 off 13) and Hardik Pandya (47 off 18) then unleashed a fierce onslaught in the final overs, pummeling the boundary rope. Bangladesh&#39;s bowler Tanzim Hasan Sakib picked up three wickets but conceded 66 runs in 4 overs, leaving their entire bowling unit reeling from India&#39;s relentless attack.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bangladesh&#39;s response fell short, with Parvez Hossain Emon dismissed for a golden duck, setting the tone for their innings. Despite Towhid Hridoy&#39;s resilient 63* and Litton Das&#39;s brisk 42, they never seemed to be in contention. Ravi Bishnoi was India&#39;s standout bowler, claiming 3 wickets for 30 runs in 4 overs, choking the Bangladesh middle order. Mayank Yadav&#39;s pace proved too much to handle, and Varun Chakravarthy&#39;s economical 4-0-23-0 maintained the pressure throughout.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In the end, Bangladesh&#39;s 164/7 was insufficient. India&#39;s dominant performance highlighted their strength in both batting and bowling. While questions may arise about Bangladesh&#39;s strategy, for now, India can revel in their well-deserved victory and the confidence it brings.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto | Bangladesh Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\">&quot;We didn&rsquo;t play our best cricket today. We didn&rsquo;t execute our batting plans, and with the ball, we were good in patches but overall didn&rsquo;t bowl well enough.</span></strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>We need to believe in ourselves, and the players have to keep working on their game. I thought Hridoy batted well today, and the seamers executed their plans nicely. However, the top-order batsmen really need to improve&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sanju Samson | Player Of The Match :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Our dressing room is full of positive energy, and I&rsquo;m happy the team is celebrating my success. It can be frustrating at times, knowing what you&#39;re capable of, and I&#39;ve always felt I could do more. But with experience, I&rsquo;ve learned to handle pressure and deal with failures since I&rsquo;ve faced them a lot.My focus was on sticking to the process and trusting that I&rsquo;d perform. There&rsquo;s always pressure when playing for your country, but I wanted to deliver. I kept things simple, taking it one ball at a time. The leadership has shown immense faith in me, not just with words but through their actions as well.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hardik Pandya | Player Of The Series :<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;The freedom the skipper and coach have given us is really benefiting everyone in the team. It&rsquo;s allowing us to bring out the best in each other. When you enjoy each other&rsquo;s success, it creates a hunger to do even more. Physically, I&rsquo;m feeling good, and I&rsquo;m grateful for that. That shot over covers, off the back foot, was just a chip that cleared the ropes&mdash;one of my favourites because it&rsquo;s not something you pull off every day.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;I think we&#39;ve achieved a lot as a team. I had mentioned that we wanted to build a team of selfless cricketers, and we&rsquo;re seeing that happen, with everyone enjoying each other&rsquo;s performances. The camaraderie is really showing. As Gauti bhai said before the series, no one is bigger than the team&mdash;whether you&#39;re on 49 or 99, you still have to go for the big shot. That&#39;s exactly what Sanju did today.We need to stay flexible with both batting and bowling, and it&rsquo;s great to see bowlers stepping up when needed and batters being adaptable. Their performances were commendable. In terms of improvement, we just need to keep up the good habits on the field and remain consistent.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Men in Blue are set to return to Test cricket with a three-match series against New Zealand, kicking off at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. Fresh off a dominant victory over Bangladesh in both T20Is and Tests, India are brimming with confidence as they inch closer to securing a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final. With a near-unchanged lineup, the home side is looking to continue their impressive form on familiar turf.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India has a clear advantage. Their squad, led by Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and the lethal spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, is a force to be reckoned with&mdash;especially at home. The return of pace ace Jasprit Bumrah adds even more firepower to India&rsquo;s bowling attack. With only three more wins needed from their remaining eight Tests to secure a WTC final berth, the hosts are in a strong position.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For New Zealand, the absence of Kane Williamson leaves a significant gap in their batting lineup. However, the Kiwis will need more than individual heroics to challenge India&rsquo;s depth and form.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Weather could play a role, with rain expected in Bengaluru. If the pitch becomes seamer-friendly, New Zealand might find some respite by putting India into bat under cloudy skies. But even wet conditions are unlikely to shake India&rsquo;s confidence, given their well-rounded squad.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head In Tests:</strong><br />\n<br />\nIn 62 Test matches between India and New Zealand, India has claimed victory 22 times, while New Zealand has won 13 matches. The remaining 27 games ended in draws. On Indian soil, the two teams have clashed in 36 Tests, with India winning 17 and New Zealand managing only 2 wins. Notably, the Kiwis&#39; last victory in India dates back to 1988, highlighting India&#39;s dominance at home over the past few decades.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (15)_1729016028.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Did You Know?</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe Last Time NZ defeated India in Tests in India, Ajaz Patel was less than 40 days old, and other New Zealand players from the current squad were not born!<br />\nNew Zealand have never defeated India in Bengaluru in their six attempts so far!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8:57 AM IST: The Toss has been Delayed due to Rain<br />\n<br />\n11:00 AM IST: It&#39;s Still Drizzling at Bengaluru and the wait continues!<br />\n<br />\n11:30 AM IST: That Will be Lunch On Day 1!<br />\n<br />\n1:10 PM IST: Just when it seemed like the rain had eased, it&rsquo;s back again<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/rain.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n1:51 PM IST:&nbsp;The rain has stopped, and the covers are coming off.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/clapping.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>2:00 PM IST: And... unfortunately, the covers are back on as the drizzles have returned.

Sarfaraz, in just his fourth Test, showed great maturity too. When you&#39;re clear-headed, things fall into place.<br />\nI knew overcast conditions would be tough, but I didn&rsquo;t expect us to be bowled out for under 50. Full credit to New Zealand for bowling brilliantly. These things happen, but we&rsquo;ll take the positives and move forward. We&rsquo;ve bounced back before, like we did against England, and we&rsquo;re ready for the next game.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tom Latham | New Zealand Captain:</strong><span style=\"color:#000000\"><br />\n<strong>&quot;We were considering batting first too, so it was a good toss to lose. The bowlers hit the right areas and bowled India out cheaply, which set things up for us. We knew India would come hard in the second innings, but we bowled well with the second new ball to finish the job.&nbsp;Honestly, I never expected that. The bowlers did a great job, and the conditions helped us, but full credit to the team. Rachin and Southee&rsquo;s partnership with the bat was also crucial for building a solid lead&nbsp;He&rsquo;s been fantastic, troubling us in the nets with his extra bounce and pace. Having Tim Southee&rsquo;s experience alongside him was brilliant.&nbsp;Rachin was outstanding with the bat, setting the tone beautifully. He&rsquo;s shown his class over the last year, and we&rsquo;re lucky to have him on our side.&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rachin Ravindra | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s a nice city and a good wicket to bat on. It&rsquo;s about having clarity in what needs to be done, and preparation helps. I&rsquo;ve worked on playing on different surfaces&mdash;red soil, black soil, and against various types of bowlers. I was fortunate to get those facilities in Chennai. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m looking to attack, but I focus on scoring when possible. The support has been amazing, and it&rsquo;s great to have family backing me, I&nbsp;enjoyed my time coming out here and playing</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India returns to the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune for the second Test against New Zealand, eager to bounce back after a rare home defeat. The pitch, with lower bounce and more turn, plays perfectly into India&rsquo;s strengths, offering an ideal platform for their world-class spinners.Rohit Sharma&rsquo;s team has made a key addition with Washington Sundar, who adds depth to the attack. Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant, after his outstanding partnership with Sarfaraz Khan in Bengaluru, is fully fit and ready for action.India&rsquo;s shock first-innings collapse in the opening Test, where they were bowled out for 46, was followed by a spirited fightback, but New Zealand&rsquo;s disciplined bowling, led by Tim Southee, sealed the win.All eyes are on Rohit&#39;s men to demonstrate the cricket that has made them a powerhouse in home conditions. With their wealth of talent, strategic depth, and home advantage, Team India stands ready to produce another memorable performance in their history.<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nThe surface composition is consistent&mdash;black soil characteristics are seen at both venues, Bangalore and Pune. Looking at the crucial good length zone, we&#39;re seeing significantly less moisture and minimal grass cover. With these conditions, batting first would be the optimal choice for whoever wins the toss, and spinners should find assistance right from the start.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-10-25T102853_1729832365.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss</strong>:- <strong>New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat first.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tom Latham:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>We&#39;ve chosen to bat first today. The wicket looks somewhat changed from our previous game - much less grass coverage out there. We&#39;re anticipating the ball to turn, which is typical when playing in this region. It&#39;s been a tremendously special achievement for our squad, and while we took time to enjoy that milestone, we&#39;re now completely focused on our game here in Pune. Matt Henry misses due to niggle while Santner replaces him in the squad.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rohit Sharma:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We Would have preferred to bat first as well. That first Test was challenging - the opening session didn&#39;t work in our favor, but our second innings batting showed real character. There are positive takeaways from that match which we&#39;ll look to build on here. It&#39;s crucial to find momentum when you&#39;re on the back foot in Test cricket, and that&#39;s exactly what we managed. The surface is looking quite dry. We recognize the critical importance of those initial 10 overs. We&#39;re making three changes to our lineup - we&#39;ll be without Siraj, KL and Kuldeep today. Akash Deep, Washington and Gill will take their places.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n",

Winning the toss and opting to bat first, New Zealand put up a competitive total of 259 runs, thanks to crucial half-centuries from Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway. India&#39;s spinners dominated, with Washington Sundar claiming seven wickets and R Ashwin taking three.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, the Indian batting lineup struggled against New Zealand&rsquo;s spinners, particularly Mitchell Santner, who delivered a masterclass by taking seven wickets. India was bowled out for a mere 156, with Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill both scoring 30. Trailing by 103 runs, New Zealand built on their lead, scoring 255 in their second innings. Tom Latham led the charge with a resilient 86, setting India a challenging target of 359 runs. Sundar continued his good form with four wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 359, India was dismissed for 245. Santner once again proved to be India&rsquo;s nemesis, picking up another five-wicket haul. Despite Jaiswal&rsquo;s fighting knock of 77, India fell short. With this victory, New Zealand sealed the series 2-0, with one match remaining.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRohit | India captain:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Disappointing. It&#39;s not what we expected. Got to give credit to NZ - they played better than us. We failed to capitalise on certain moments. We failed to respond to those challenges. And we sit here today. Didn&#39;t think we batted well enough to get runs on the board. You&#39;ve got to pick 20 wickets to win, yes, but batters have to put runs on the board. Was a great fightback to restrict them to 250-odd but we knew it was going to be challenging. When they started off, they were 200/3 and for us to come back and get them bowled out for 259 was a great effort. Wasn&#39;t a pitch where a lot was happening. We just didn&#39;t bat well enough. Things would&#39;ve been slightly different had we got a bit closer in the first innings. We want to show up well at Wankhede and try and win that Test. It&#39;s a collective failure. I&#39;m not somebody who would blame just the batters or the bowlers. We will come out with better intent, better ideas and better methods at Wankhede.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Latham | NZ captain:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Really special feeling. Proud to be in this position. Whole team effort and a clear example of everyone pitching in. When you come over here you want to put your best foot forward. Putting runs on the board at the start was really important. Have to mention Mitch Santner. He was fantastic. Has been around the group a long time, and to finally get a break and bowl the way he has - credit to him. It was about trying to stick to our basics and play the long game. Both surfaces have been different, we&#39;ve needed to adapt and we&#39;ve done that very well. The method we played with last night - to put ourselves on the front foot - was terrifc. The way GP played this morning was really important. We knew India were going to come out hot. Didn&#39;t realise they were going to come that hot, but we managed to get the breakthroughs in the middle session. Those last two wickets took an age but when Tim took that catch we were really happy.</span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSantner | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>My approach stayed pretty consistent (in second innings). The conditions were a bit more challenging this time around. Have to acknowledge India&#39;s aggressive intent - it was probably the best way to play on that surface. We just maintained our discipline throughout. My body&#39;s feeling it now, especially the side after that extended spell of 20-plus overs. But in those moments, you just want to keep pushing through. Each wicket gave me a boost of energy. Really satisfied to have played my part in the team&#39;s success. Securing a series win here in India is something special - it&#39;s such a tough achievement. Taking wickets definitely helps build your confidence. As spinners, our focus is always on consistency - hitting those same spots repeatedly while mixing up the pace subtly - that&#39;s the foundation of our bowling unit&#39;s approach.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Facing an uncharacteristic 2-0 deficit at home, the team will look to rally under captain Rohit Sharma to end the series on a high. Despite setbacks in Bengaluru and Pune, India has shown resilience and will aim to bring that intensity to Mumbai.<br />\n<br />\nNew Zealand&rsquo;s success has been a testament to their preparation and persistence, with bowlers like Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel rising to the occasion. However, India&rsquo;s own spinners are primed for the Wankhede pitch, known for its bounce and turn, which could tilt conditions in the hosts&rsquo; favor.<br />\n<br />\nIndia&rsquo;s top order will be eager to set a strong foundation and put pressure on New Zealand, while the bowlers look to apply a decisive impact. Though the series may be out of reach, the team remains focused on delivering a performance that upholds their high standards and ensures vital WTC points. Expect an intense contest as India seeks to close out the series with renewed determination.<br />\n<br />\nToss:- New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat first.&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-11-01T093557_1730434043.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tom Latham | New Zealand Captain: <span style=\"color:#000000\">&quot;We will bat first. It looks a good surface. Hopefully, we can put some runs on the board. Focusing on this Test. We did well in Bengaluru and Pune. But now the focus is on this one. Test Cricket is a funny game. We did not play badly against Sri Lanka. We have tried to keep things simple and play our brand of cricket. Whether you are batting first or bowling first, you have to play well. Sodhi and Henry come in for Southee and Santner&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> &quot;We would have batted as well. Yeah absolutely, we understand we haven&#39;t played well. But again gives us another opportunity to come back and looks a good wicket. Hopefully, we can restrict them to as low as possible and then do well with the bat. Right now our focus is on this Test match. On the back of the mind you need to keep in mind about that (WTC), but right now we need to play our best cricket which we haven&#39;t this series. Unfortunately, Bumrah is not well and Siraj comes in place of him.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

A result sending shockwaves through World Test Championship calculations, with India&#39;s final hopes now precariously placed.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;<strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Losing a series or losing a Test match is never easy. It is something that is not digestible. We didn&#39;t play good cricket. New Zealand played better than us. Credit to them. We have to accept that we didn&#39;t play the best cricket and made a lot of mistakes. We didn&#39;t score enough first innings score in the previous two matches and were always behind in the game. In this game, we had the lead; we were a little ahead, but we failed to capitalize. While chasing a target, we need to have runs on the board. I had that in mind. It didn&#39;t come off. And when it doesn&#39;t come off, it looks bad. We come up with a certain mindset while batting; if it comes off, it is great, or else it looks really bad. I had specific strategies that didn&#39;t work this series. Our cricket wasn&#39;t up to par in these conditions, and we&#39;re facing those consequences. As I mentioned, our performance wasn&#39;t at its best, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re in this position. Pant, Gill, and Washington demonstrated how to bat on these surfaces - you need to be proactive. We&#39;ve been playing on similar pitches for three years now. Unfortunately, our tactical approaches didn&#39;t succeed this series. I take responsibility for not delivering my best, both as captain and batsman. As a team unit, we fell short.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ajaz Patel | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;Spin bowling is fundamentally about finding your rhythm. When conditions are favorable, you need to seize the opportunity completely. I was feeling confident during the morning session too. After lunch, there was significantly more turn which worked in my favor. My approach was to keep things uncomplicated and try to outthink the batsmen. Regarding the contest with Pant - he&#39;s an exceptional batsman who put us under considerable pressure. It required creative thinking and alternative strategies to deal with him.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Will Young | Player of the Series:&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">&quot;Firstly, for the team to come here and win the series, it is huge. To win one game here is so huge, but to come out again and again and win the series with a 3-0 margin is unbelievable. Really proud of the boys. My batting approach was about simplicity. I focus on maintaining a clear mindset and trusting my defensive technique. It&#39;s also important to identify scoring opportunities. Like ducks sitting on water, staying calm. We really enjoyed playing together as a team. About taking Kane&#39;s number 3 position? Well, let&#39;s see what happens in the next series.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Tom Latham | New Zealand Captain:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m absolutely ecstatic. Looking back at the series start, the team has performed exceptionally. To achieve this in Mumbai, on a challenging surface for both batting and bowling, is incredibly satisfying. Our success came from adapting to each venue&#39;s conditions. In Bengaluru, we had different players stepping up at crucial moments. Last week it was Mitch&#39;s performance, and this time Ajaz, who particularly enjoys bowling here in Mumbai. Our approach was about keeping things uncomplicated. This is exactly what we discussed weeks ago - being proactive and understanding India&#39;s style while adapting our game accordingly. The team executed well, and I&#39;m proud to be standing here with this result. We believed our runs were sufficient in these conditions. On this wicket, we knew it would be challenging. Each victory is special - the women&#39;s World Cup triumph is fantastic, our win here is remarkable, and the Black Caps&#39; rugby success last night makes it a brilliant time for New Zealand sports.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

With India riding high as T20 World Champions, thanks to their recent win over South Africa in the finals, the Proteas are keen for redemption on home soil.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Led by the explosive Suryakumar Yadav, India comes in with a six-match winning streak. Despite missing some senior players, they bring young stars like Abhishek Sharma and Rinku Singh, adding depth to their power-packed lineup. South Africa, led by Aiden Markram, fields an almost full-strength squad featuring David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen, making them formidable in familiar conditions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This series promises exciting matchups: Suryakumar&rsquo;s strokeplay against South Africa&rsquo;s pace attack and Miller&rsquo;s finishing prowess against India&rsquo;s spinners. With matches across iconic venues in Durban, Gqeberha, Centurion, and Johannesburg, fans can expect a fiercely competitive series as India looks to extend its T20 dominance, while South Africa aims to protect its home pride in what&rsquo;s sure to be an intense battle.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head in T20Is:<br />\nIn the 27 games battled between the two teams, India edge over South Africa by 15-11 and one game ended in no-result.<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report By Shaun Pollock:</strong></p>\n\n<p>An overcast, blustery evening sets the stage for a gripping contest here at Kingsmead. Veteran all-rounder Shaun Pollock notes the hard, true surface is primed to offer pace, bounce and carry - a tantalizing prospect for the quicks with the new ball.</p>\n\n<p>However, the capricious Durban breeze could prove a double-edged sword, potentially aiding the seamers early on, but also allowing the batters to play their strokes confidently. The captain winning the toss faces a crucial decision - capitalize on helpful bowling conditions, or post a challenging first-innings total before the forecast rain arrives later?</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Toss:- </strong>South Africa have won the toss and decided to bowl first.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Aiden Markram:</strong><strong>&nbsp;We&nbsp;will bowl first today. The pitch looks quite good, and since there&#39;s been some rain this week, we&rsquo;re hoping to use any moisture that may still be there to our advantage. It&rsquo;s also a fantastic chance for the new guys to debut on home turf, and we want them to enjoy every moment of it. We&rsquo;re a very competitive side, and our discussions have been centered on how we can drive towards positive results</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav:&nbsp;We were hoping to bat first. The pitch looks good&mdash;much better than the practice one&mdash;so our goal is to put up a solid total. The team has made my role easier; everyone plays with a fearless mindset, just like they do for their franchises, and they&rsquo;ve brought that same energy here.</strong></span></p>\n",

After being put in to bat, India set a formidable target, reaching 202/8, thanks largely to an impressive century from Sanju Samson. He found solid support from Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav, who chipped in with valuable contributions to keep the momentum going. South Africa&#39;s Gerald Coetzee was their standout bowler, claiming 3 wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In pursuit of 203, South Africa struggled from the start and fell short by 61 runs, never really managing to get into the chase. India&#39;s bowlers dominated the innings, with Varun and Ravi Bishnoi sharing six wickets equally, each taking three crucial scalps. Heinrich Klaasen managed to top-score for South Africa with 25 runs, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to steady their innings. The South African batting lineup crumbled, eventually getting bowled out for 141.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Sanju Samson (Player Of The Match)</span></strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">I&rsquo;m really enjoying my time out there in the middle. I&rsquo;ve been in good form, so I&rsquo;m making the most of it while it lasts. It all comes down to intent&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been focused on playing aggressively and keeping the team on the front foot. You have to aim for those boundary shots; sometimes they work, sometimes they don&rsquo;t. This was an important win because South Africa is a strong team, especially at home. We&rsquo;re thrilled to kick off the series in this way.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Aiden Markram ( South Africa Captain)<br />\nThe toss didn&rsquo;t play a huge role today. The new ball had a bit of bounce and movement off the surface, which made things tricky early on. From our perspective, it really came down to our batting&mdash;we could have done better in that area.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Suryakumar Yadav (India Captain)<br />\nOh really, I didn&rsquo;t know that! It&rsquo;s great, though, that we&rsquo;ve been sticking to our usual style of play. We haven&rsquo;t changed much, so I&rsquo;m pleased with the win. Sanju&rsquo;s hard work is paying off now&mdash;he even kept going for big shots in the 90s, always putting the team first. It&rsquo;s great to have him with us. Yes, we planned to use spinners against Miller and Klaasen, and they both delivered perfectly. Honestly, it does feel a bit easier (laughs). As I mentioned in the press conference, the team has simplified my job, and everyone understands their roles well</strong></span>.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

After Sanju Samson&#39;s masterclass lit up Durban in the opener, the visitors now have their sights set on a commanding 2-0 lead at St George&#39;s Park.The Proteas find themselves in familiar troubled waters, their batting lineup still dizzy from the spin web woven by Varun Chakaravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi. But write off Aiden Markram&#39;s men at your peril &ndash; this fortress of St George&#39;s Park has been their happy hunting ground, with three wins from their last four T20Is.South Africa&#39;s cavalry arrives in the form of Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller, two explosive game-changers who could turn the tide. Yet, the hosts&#39; Achilles heel against spin remains a concern that needs urgent addressing.Team India, meanwhile, shows no signs of tinkering with their winning formula, though opener Abhishek Sharma&#39;s form raises eyebrows. The visitors&#39; batting arsenal looks locked and loaded with Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma in murderous form.As the Sunday showdown beckons, one burning question remains: Can the Proteas solve their spin puzzle, or will India&#39;s tweakers once again prove to be their nemesis?&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Ashwell Prince &amp; Shaun Pollock:</strong><br />\n<strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s overcast here in Gqeberha, and there&rsquo;s a chance of rain. The pitch looks slightly different from the usual surface, with a bit more grass cover than we&rsquo;re accustomed to. The conditions have changed slightly with the cloud cover and recent rain, which will likely favour the seamers. The grass should help the seam bowlers get some movement, and though it&rsquo;s firm and solid, batters should feel encouraged too. There isn&rsquo;t expected to be much spin tonight, but this venue often holds something for the spinners despite appearances. South Africa struggled against spin in the first T20I, so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if that plays a role here. The surface is hard underneath, meaning the ball should carry nicely through to the keeper.It looks like a good pitch to the eye, with something for both batters and seamers. The key question: will India&rsquo;s two spinners enjoy these conditions? With rain looming, teams might prefer to bowl first.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#16a085\">South Africa Won the Toss and Elected to field&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nAiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;We&rsquo;re opting to bowl first with a bit of rain around. Hopefully, there&rsquo;ll be some assistance for the seamers early on. Reeza Hendricks is back in, replacing Patrick Kruger. For us, it&rsquo;s about winning those 240 balls of cricket, and staying focused on playing well rather than worrying about the result. Hopefully, the outcome will be in our favor.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nSuryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We achieved what we set out to in the first T20I. We wanted to bat first, make a statement, and stick to our brand of cricket, so I&rsquo;m happy with how things went.

Opting to bowl, the Proteas&#39; disciplined attack stifled India from the outset. Early dismissals of Samson, Sharma and Yadav left the visitors reeling at 15/3. Pandya&#39;s gritty 39* lifted India to 124/6, but it seemed under par. The South African chase stumbled as spin wizard Chakravarthy spun a web, his 5/17 leaving the hosts 86/7. However, local hero Stubbs (47*) and Coetzee engineered a vital 42-run stand to take SA over the line. Despite Chakravarthy&#39;s heroics, India&#39;s pacers couldn&#39;t close it out, allowing the SA tail to hold their nerve. This absorbing encounter sets up a mouthwatering decider, with both sides showcasing resilience and match-winners. South Africa&#39;s bowlers first set the tone, before Stubbs&#39; composure and Chakravarthy&#39;s brilliance provided the drama in a low-scoring thriller. The series is evenly poised, primed for an enthralling finale&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTristan Stubbs | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;We were lucky that the required rate never got out of hand. I aimed to get around 30 off the last three overs, and with some help from the dew and Coetzee&rsquo;s big shots, we managed to cross the line. Playing here, with the crowd behind us, is always special. Now that it&rsquo;s 1-1, we have everything to play for in the next match.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We always back whatever total we put up, and I reminded the team to fight till the end, regardless of the score. In T20, defending 125 isn&rsquo;t ideal, but I&rsquo;m proud of how we bowled. Varun Chakaravarthy&rsquo;s five-wicket haul was remarkable, especially under pressure defending a low total. He&rsquo;s worked hard, and it showed today. We&rsquo;re heading to Jo&rsquo;burg with the series tied 1-1, and it promises to be exciting cricket.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Aiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;I thought we bowled well today; the bowlers stuck to the plans, and I&rsquo;m proud of them. Our batting wasn&rsquo;t great as we lost wickets in clusters, which made things tricky. Thankfully, my finger&rsquo;s doing fine. Hats off to Coetzee and Stubbs&mdash;they came off a break and showed great hunger. To deliver such a performance against India is always satisfying. Levelling the series going into the Highveld is fantastic, even if it wasn&rsquo;t the way we ideally wanted to get over the line.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

The spin duo of Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi has added another dimension to their bowling arsenal, with Chakravarthy&#39;s exceptional spells (3/25 and 5/17) highlighting India&#39;s versatility in different conditions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>South Africa showed their resilience at St George&#39;s Park, with Tristan Stubbs&#39; composed 47* leading a calculated chase. The Proteas&#39; pace battery, spearheaded by Gerald Coetzee, has consistently challenged the batters, while Keshav Maharaj&#39;s economic bowling has provided crucial control.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The series now shifts to Centurion&#39;s pace-friendly terrain, where batting historically flourishes at 9.46 runs per over. Both teams have momentum to build upon - India&#39;s sophisticated spin strategy and dynamic batting lineup, matched against South Africa&#39;s pace prowess and home conditions advantage.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With the addition of Lutho Sipamla to the Proteas squad, the stage is set for an enthralling contest between two sides showcasing cricket&#39;s next generation of talent.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#16a085\">South Africa won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nAiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;We&#39;ll bowl first again. The wicket looks good, and it tends to play better under lights, so we&#39;re sticking with that plan. Our last game wasn&rsquo;t our best, but it&rsquo;s a positive that we still managed to come out on top. It&rsquo;s about finding rhythm and time in the middle, and we back our players to perform. We&rsquo;ve made one change: Nqaba Peter is out, and Lutho Sipamla comes in.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nSuryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&rsquo;ve done well batting first in the last two games, and we wanted to put runs on the board anyway. The boys have shown up with clear plans and executed them well, so I&rsquo;m happy with how they&rsquo;re performing. The message is simple&mdash;stick to your skills, go out there, and enjoy yourselves. They&rsquo;ve really made my job easier. We&rsquo;ve made one change: Ramandeep Singh is making his debut, while Avesh Khan sits out. Avesh has been great for us, but we needed to make room, so Ramandeep gets his chance.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Abhishek Sharma supported with a brisk 50 off 25 balls. Despite wickets falling at regular intervals, India maintained a high scoring rate, aided by Ramandeep Singh&rsquo;s quick 15 off 6 balls towards the end.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>South Africa&rsquo;s chase was spirited, especially with Marco Jansen blazing his way to a 17-ball 54, smashing four fours and five sixes. Heinrich Klaasen added a swift 41 off 22 balls, keeping the visitors in the hunt. However, India&rsquo;s bowlers held their nerve, with Arshdeep Singh taking 3/37 in his 4 overs, including the crucial wicket of Jansen in the final overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>While Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel chipped in with a wicket each, it was Arshdeep&rsquo;s breakthrough at critical moments that sealed the game for India.

The catch was tricky under the lights, but I&rsquo;m doing well now. Honestly, I can&rsquo;t describe it&mdash;it was a dream to score a hundred for my country, and I&rsquo;m really happy. All credit to our captain, Suryakumar Yadav, for giving me the opportunity at number three. He encouraged me before the game, saying I had the potential for this role. Huge thanks to him for the support.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Aiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Really proud of the team, especially with the contributions from the middle and lower middle order. Here in Centurion, when the middle order steps up, it usually sets you up for a strong finish. Once a partnership builds, things can escalate quickly. At this venue, you almost expect to chase totals down&mdash;it becomes an over-by-over battle. Marco was fantastic in the last over; if you keep doing the right things, success follows. The batters can take confidence from this, and the bowlers will look to fine-tune their skills before we head to Joburg.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;As captain, I felt we played the brand of cricket we set out to play. We&rsquo;ve been talking about playing the way we do for our franchises or state teams, and I believe staying clear-minded is crucial. Watching our batters perform like they did today made my job so much easier, and it feels like we&rsquo;re moving in the right direction as a team. The energy, aggression, and intent on display were really satisfying to see. Tilak Varma actually came to my room before the game and asked if he could bat at number 3, and I&rsquo;m really happy for him and his family that it worked out so well.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

India, leading 2-1, look to cap off their outstanding T20I Campaign with another victory.The visitors have found different heroes throughout - Samson&#39;s ton in the opener, Chakravarthy&#39;s five-fer in the second, and Tilak Varma&#39;s maiden T20I century in Centurion steering them to an unassailable lead.Despite captain Markram winning all three tosses, South Africa hasn&#39;t converted advantages into victories. Their batting lacks consistency while bowling discipline remains a concern. Still seeking their first bilateral T20I series win in eight attempts, the Proteas aim to level the series 2-2.The Wanderers&#39; pace-friendly conditions could favor the hosts&#39; fast bowling arsenal. However, India&#39;s new aggressive batting approach, evident throughout 2024, makes them favorites even on bouncy tracks.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won The Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nSuryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&rsquo;re batting first again, as we&rsquo;ve been doing well with that approach and want to keep the momentum.

No changes to the playing XI.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Aiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;We were leaning towards batting but weren&rsquo;t entirely sure, so it wasn&rsquo;t the worst toss to lose. Our focus today is to put together a complete performance in all three departments, something we haven&rsquo;t fully achieved yet. We&rsquo;re getting closer to that 100% mark. Playing at the Bullring is always exciting, and while we can only level the series, coming back from 1-0 down gives us confidence. That said, execution will be key.

Our plans were clear from the start, and we wanted to continue the way we played on our last tour. The batting performances from Sanju, Tilak, and Abhishek were simply amazing. The wicket had something in it after the temperature dropped, and our bowlers executed our plans to perfection. Winning the T20 WC has given us a big boost, and this series victory in South Africa will stay with me forever.

This five-match Test series is pivotal for both teams, with significant implications for the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) standings.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India, currently second on the WTC table, faces a formidable challenge. To secure a spot in the WTC final, they must clinch four out of the five Tests&mdash;a daunting task, especially on Australian soil. The series opener at Perth&#39;s Optus Stadium adds to the intrigue, as Australia boasts an unbeaten record at this venue. Compounding India&#39;s challenges, captain Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the first Test due to personal reasons, and opener Shubman Gill has been sidelined with a thumb injury. In their absence, vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah will lead the side, with seasoned campaigner Virat Kohli anchoring a batting lineup infused with youthful talent eager to make their mark.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Despite a recent 3-0 series loss to New Zealand, India remain optimistic. The team is determined to reverse their fortunes and draw inspiration from their previous successes Down Under. The blend of experience and fresh energy could be the catalyst they need to challenge Australia&#39;s dominance.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Australia, perched atop the WTC standings, enters the series with confidence. Although they haven&#39;t played a Test in over six months, their formidable record at the Optus Stadium and the prospect of a subsequent series against Sri Lanka keep them focused. To secure their place in the WTC final, Australia needs four wins from their remaining seven matches. The team is keen to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, having lost the last two home series to India.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>As the top two teams in Test cricket collide, fans can anticipate a series brimming with intensity, skill, and drama. Will India&#39;s resilience and hunger for redemption prevail, or will Australia&#39;s home advantage and strategic acumen secure them the series? Cricket enthusiasts worldwide await the unfolding of this epic contest.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in BGT:</strong><br />\n<strong>In the 56 matches contested between the two teams, India edged out Australia with 24 wins to 20 wins, while 12 of the other matches&nbsp;ended in a draw.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (16)_1732190896.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: India won the Toss and Elected to Bat First&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jasprit Bumrah | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We are going to bat first.

The hosts, who had never lost at Perth Stadium in four previous Tests, were dismissed for 238, with Bumrah and Siraj leading India&#39;s charge.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s victory ranks alongside their famous wins at Gabba 2021 and Adelaide 2003. Captain Bumrah&#39;s leadership and bowling excellence epitomized India&#39;s dominance, turning early adversity into their biggest win against Australia - a historic triumph that takes them to No.1 in the WTC standings&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s fairly disappointing, especially given how well we prepared for the game. But cricket is like that&mdash;you have to get back on the horse quickly after a loss. We&rsquo;ll take a couple of days off and then return to the field in Adelaide.We didn&rsquo;t really give ourselves a chance, particularly during that tricky period on Day 1. If we had navigated it better, things could have turned out differently. There are plenty of experienced players in the dressing room, and this is just the start of a big summer. It&rsquo;s a sample size of one, and I&rsquo;m confident we&rsquo;ll bounce back. Lots of conversations ahead to set things right.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jasprit Bumrah&nbsp; | India Captain &amp; Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Feeling very happy. We were under pressure in the first innings, but the way we responded was fantastic. I remember playing here in 2018&mdash;the wicket back then started soft, but this one was less spicy. Our preparation paid off well. I kept reminding everyone to trust their abilities, and it worked.Jaiswal played his best Test innings so far; his shot selection and judgment were excellent. As for Virat, I never felt he was out of form. It&rsquo;s tough to judge on challenging pitches, but he looked solid in the nets and performed well. The crowd&rsquo;s support was amazing as always&mdash;it lifts us, and we feed off that energy.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Welcome to the most awaited pink-ball Test of the BGT 2024-25, as a buoyant Indian team aims to strengthen their grip on the series at the historic Adelaide Oval.After their commanding performance in Perth, Team India enters this day-night contest with renewed confidence. Captain Rohit Sharma&#39;s return fortifies an already formidable lineup, with the skipper opting to bat in the middle order. This tactical decision maintains the momentum of the successful opening combination of KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who have shown remarkable understanding at the top.The Adelaide Oval holds special significance for India, particularly Virat Kohli, whose record at this venue stands testament to his mastery in Australian conditions. His recent form, coupled with the team&#39;s comprehensive preparation in the practice match against the PM&#39;s XI, positions India strongly for this crucial encounter.India&#39;s bowling arsenal, led by the exceptional Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, has already demonstrated their ability to dominate in Australian conditions.The visitors&#39; preparation has been meticulous, with specific focus on adapting to the unique challenges of pink-ball cricket. The return of Shubman Gill, who looked in sublime touch during the practice match, further strengthens India&#39;s batting credentials.As the sun sets over Adelaide&#39;s picturesque skyline, this promises to be a fascinating contest where India&#39;s tactical acumen and batting prowess meet the challenges of day-night Test cricket. With momentum firmly on their side, Team India looks primed to script another memorable chapter in their Australian sojourn</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Matthew Hayden &amp; Sunil Gavaskar</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>&quot;About a week ago, there was a lot of grass on the pitch, but much of it has been trimmed over the last few days. There&rsquo;s still around 6 mm left, which should offer plenty of assistance to the fast bowlers when the ball is new and hard. After that initial period, Adelaide pitches are typically good for batting. It looks like it could seam around quite a bit early on. Eventually, batting becomes easier, but bowlers often dominate late on Day 2, and averages dip. I&rsquo;ve also noticed lines running up and down the wicket, with thicker grass cover than last year.&quot;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:</strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;\n<p><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&rsquo;d like to bat first. The pitch looks good&mdash;slightly dry but with enough grass for some early carry. As the game progresses, it should become better for batting and offer something for everyone, so we&rsquo;re in for a good contest. I&rsquo;ve been here for about two weeks now, had good net sessions, and even played a practice game, so I&rsquo;m ready. The team&rsquo;s mood is vibrant. We put in a great performance in Perth and want to carry that momentum. It&rsquo;s a long series, and while breaks are welcome, maintaining the rhythm is crucial. We&rsquo;ve made three changes. I&rsquo;m back, Gill is back, and Ashwin returns in place of Washi, Padikkal, and Jurel. I&rsquo;ll be batting in the middle order&mdash;it&rsquo;s different, but I&rsquo;m ready for the challenge.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Yes, we would have chosen to bat first. But on Day 1 with a pink ball, it might nip around a bit. It&rsquo;s always nice to start fresh here&mdash;we&rsquo;ve had success at this venue. Every series against India seems to bring that challenge, and though we weren&rsquo;t at our best last week, preparations have been good, and the boys are ready. There might be more swing today since it&rsquo;s muggy, but hopefully, it&#39;s not as bad as yesterday. We&rsquo;ve made one change: Josh Hazlewood is out, and Scott Boland comes in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n",

Travis Head&#39;s attacking 140 helped Australia post 337, building a significant first-innings lead.Young Nitish Reddy showed promise with twin scores of 42, but India&#39;s total of 175 in the second innings meant Australia needed just 19 to win. Cummins and Boland were the key performers with the ball.The series now stands level at 1-1 as both teams head to Brisbane, with momentum shifting between the sides in what&#39;s proving to be an engaging Border-Gavaskar Trophy&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Travis Head | Player Of The Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;It feels great to get some runs here. It&rsquo;s just another game, but I felt in good touch last week, and it&rsquo;s nice to continue that form.The dressing room atmosphere is fantastic, despite what people might say. Nothing is ever guaranteed in this game, but it&rsquo;s great to have this momentum. Now it&rsquo;s about moving forward and building on it.Pat Cummins gives me a lot of confidence, and I saw the second new ball as a great opportunity to score quickly. I just tried to make the most of it, and luckily, I managed to get things rolling.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It was a disappointing week for us. Australia simply played better cricket. We had our moments, but failing to capitalize on them cost us the game.What we did in Perth was special, and we wanted to replicate that here. But every Test comes with its own set of challenges. We knew it would be tough, but credit to Australia &ndash; they were the better side in this match.There&rsquo;s not much time before the next Test, and as a team, we&rsquo;re eager to reflect on what worked for us in Perth and what we did well the last time we played at the Gabba. We&rsquo;ll take those lessons and aim to bounce back.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s been a fantastic week. We were far from the team we wanted to be in Perth, but this is exactly how we aim to play.It feels great to pick up a few wickets, and I&rsquo;m really happy with the fifer. Starc was amazing out there &ndash; he&rsquo;s been doing it consistently for over a decade, and I feel very lucky and privileged to share the field with him.Head loves batting here, no doubt about it. When he came in, the game could have gone either way, but he turned the momentum in our favor brilliantly.The lead was crucial for us. Bowling under lights was a perfect scenario &ndash; the ball moved a lot, and it played into our hands. While the pink ball does a bit more under lights, the key was securing that big first-innings lead.Scotty was fantastic, seamlessly fitting in as he always does. Hopefully, Joshy will be ready for the next Test, but if not, Scotty is just incredible.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The Brisbane Cricket Ground (Gabba) is ready to witness a gripping encounter as Australia and India prepare for the third Test, with the series tied at 1-1. Both teams will be looking to take the lead in what promises to be an epic battle, and the stakes couldn&rsquo;t be higher.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Australia enters the contest riding high after their resounding 10-wicket win over India at the Adelaide Oval. Their dominance with the pink ball has set the tone for the series, and they&rsquo;ll look to continue that momentum as they return to their fortress&mdash;the Gabba. Despite their recent strong record here, Australia is haunted by the fact they&rsquo;ve lost two out of the last four games played at this very venue. The hosts will be eager to put that behind them and showcase their strengths. Travis Head has been sublime, scoring 89 in Perth and 140 in Adelaide, while Marnus Labuschagne has been another contributor. The bowling attack has been firing on all cylinders, with Mitchell Starc taking a match-winning six wickets in the first innings and Pat Cummins claiming a five-fer in the second. Scott Boland has also been key, dismissing Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in either of the innings.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>On the other hand, India enters this Test with plenty to prove after their batting struggles in three of the four innings so far. Despite this, there have been moments of brilliance, notably from Nitish Reddy, who has been positive, and Kohli and Jaiswal, scoring centuries in Perth. Jasprit Bumrah has been India&rsquo;s standout bowler with 12 wickets to his name, while Mohammad Siraj has also contributed with a four-wicket haul in Adelaide. India&rsquo;s historic three-wicket win at the Gabba last time is still fresh in their minds&mdash;will they replicate that remarkable achievement?</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>The series is poised for an intense showdown. Will Pat Cummins and his men continue their dominance, or will India deliver another stunning performance like they did at the Gabba last time? The battle for supremacy is on&mdash;who will rise to the occasion and take the lead in this high-stakes contest?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE : <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&rsquo;ve decided to bowl first. It&rsquo;s a bit overcast, and the surface looks soft. It might stick a bit, so we want to take advantage of these conditions.There&rsquo;s a lot to play for. Both teams have played well so far, and we&rsquo;re looking to bring our best. We know we&rsquo;ve been playing good cricket, but we need to capitalize on key moments, something we didn&rsquo;t do in the last Test.The guys are excited and eager to do well for their country. They want to get out there and make an impact.&nbsp;The surface does look a bit soft, and with the overcast conditions, we expect it to improve as the game progresses.We&rsquo;ve made two changes: Jadeja and Akash&nbsp;Deep come in for Harshit&nbsp;Rana and Ashwin&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pat Cummins | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;I believe this looks like a good wicket, and I&rsquo;m hoping we can put some solid runs on the board. It&rsquo;s going to be a sell-out crowd, and I expect it to be pretty loud. We had a great week in Adelaide, and I&rsquo;m really happy with how things played out. Everyone played their part. The weather in Brisbane hasn&rsquo;t impacted our preparations, and we&rsquo;ve had a good lead-up to this game. We love playing here at the Gabba, and we&rsquo;re excited for this match.

Australia, after put into bat first, amassed a formidable 445, propelled by centuries from Steve Smith and Travis Head. Smith&#39;s 101 marked a return to form, while Head&#39;s aggressive 152 showcased his growing stature in the lineup. India&#39;s spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, was the standout bowler, claiming six wickets for 76 runs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>In reply, India faced early setbacks, slipping to 74 for 5. However, resilient half-centuries from KL Rahul (84) and Ravindra Jadeja (75) steadied the innings. A crucial last-wicket partnership of 47 between Bumrah and debutant Akash Deep enabled India to reach 260, narrowly avoiding the follow-on. Australian pacers Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc were instrumental, securing four and three wickets respectively.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Persistent rain disruptions played a significant role throughout the match. Australia, with a first-innings lead of 185, declared their second innings at 89 for 7, setting India a target of 275. Bumrah continued his impressive form, taking three wickets, while Akash Deep and Mohammed Siraj shared two apiece.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India began their chase confidently, reaching 8 without loss in 2.1 overs before rain intervened once more. The inclement weather persisted, forcing the match to end in a draw. This result keeps the series level, setting the stage for a compelling fourth Test.<br />\n<br />\nRohit Sharma: India Captain</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;ll take this result. While the weather interruptions weren&#39;t ideal, heading to Melbourne with the series level at 1-1 gives us real momentum. After lunch on Day 4, we were in a tricky spot and needed someone to step up - with the weather forecast in mind, we knew we weren&#39;t going to get a full game in.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Impressed with Jadeja&#39;s performance, and Rahul&#39;s batting at the top was outstanding. The partnership between Akash Deep and Bumrah was fantastic to watch - they&#39;ve been putting in so much effort on their batting in practice sessions.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Bumrah was exceptional with the ball, and Akash Deep brings such great energy - he&#39;s always looking to make an impact in every aspect of the game. Though he&#39;s still finding his feet in international cricket, his work ethic has been tremendous. It&#39;s great to see the senior players in the group helping guide him. His batting performance showed exactly the kind of character we want in this team - someone who&#39;s willing to fight for every run.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pat Cummins: Australia Captain<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;We&#39;d prefer to be leading 2-1, but with all the rain interruptions, that was out of our control. Getting that massive total on the board put us in a commanding position from the start. Feel for Josh Hazlewood - it was just one of those situations, though the rain breaks actually worked in our favor since Mitch and I could keep going.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>The day 5 pitch had its moments of variable bounce, though it hadn&#39;t seen much action. The new ball definitely posed some challenges. Really proud of how Smith and Head batted - they were exceptional, and Alex Carey&#39;s contribution was crucial too. Nathan Lyon looked in great rhythm, Starc kept picking up important wickets - pretty much everything went according to plan.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>The Boxing Day atmosphere at the MCG with a packed house is something special - it&#39;s one of those uniquely Australian cricket moments that gets you excited from the moment you wake up.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Travis Head: Player Of The Match</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;To be honest, it feels like ages since I was at the crease. I&#39;m pleased I could make an impact and help set up the team&#39;s position with my batting in the first innings. The pitch presented some real challenges, but I managed to adapt my game as needed and I&#39;m satisfied with how I worked through those different phases. I think I&#39;ve been reading the conditions pretty well throughout this series, and I&#39;m particularly happy with the rhythm I&#39;ve found in my batting.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>The partnership with Smith was great - we kept the communication simple and clear. Seeing him batting so smoothly at the other end boosted my confidence, and we clicked well together out there. My approach when I first come in is always about figuring out what the situation demands and finding solutions to whatever challenges come up. Physically, I&#39;m carrying a bit of soreness but should be good to go for the next match.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Opting to bat first, Australia posted a formidable 474 in the first innings, powered by a superb century from Steve Smith and vital half-centuries from Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne. Jasprit Bumrah was the standout bowler for India, claiming four wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s reply saw Nitish Kumar Reddy shine with a brilliant century, supported by Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s steady 82 and Washington Sundar&rsquo;s gritty fifty. However, the Australian bowlers, led by Pat Cummins, Scott Boland, and Nathan Lyon, each with three wickets, ensured India could only manage 369, giving Australia a crucial 105-run lead.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In their second innings, Australia added 234 runs, with Labuschagne top-scoring with 70 and Bumrah picking up a fifer. India faced a daunting target of 340 on the final day. The chase began poorly as India lost key batters before lunch. Despite a resilient partnership between Rishabh Pant and Jaiswal in the second session, India&rsquo;s batting crumbled in the evening, all out for 155. Boland and Cummins were once again the wreckers-in-chief, picking three wickets each.<br />\n<br />\nRohit Sharma (India Captain):</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;This loss cuts deep. We didn&#39;t enter this match planning to surrender - our intention was to battle until the final ball, but things didn&#39;t unfold that way. While the last two sessions are fresh in everyone&#39;s mind, we need to look at the complete picture. The opportunities were there throughout the match; we had Australia on the ropes at 90/6. Despite knowing cricket can be unforgiving, our goal is to rise above challenging situations. I spent time in my room afterward, reflecting on our strategies, and I believe we gave it our all. That final partnership really turned the tide against us. Chasing 340 was always going to be a mountain to climb. Our plan was to build a foundation and keep wickets intact heading into those crucial final sessions, but I must acknowledge their exceptional bowling. We had our sights set on the target, but failed to establish the platform we needed. Winning Test matches requires finding different pathways to success, and we fell short in discovering those routes.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Regarding NKR, he&#39;s experiencing these conditions for the first time, and they can be incredibly challenging. His display of character and technical prowess was impressive. He possesses all the qualities needed for success at this level, and I&#39;m hopeful his journey will be one of continuous growth. He has the complete support of this team behind him.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">As for Bumrah, his performance was nothing short of exceptional. We&#39;ve witnessed his evolution over the years, and his impact here was remarkable. He&#39;s never been one to chase statistics - his focus is purely on serving the country and contributing to the team&#39;s success. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t receive the support he deserved from the other end.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pat Cummins (Australia Captain and Player of The Match):</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&quot;This Test match was simply extraordinary - I&#39;d rank it among the finest I&#39;ve ever participated in. The atmosphere created by the crowd throughout the week was incredible, and being part of such an occasion was special. I owe a lot to Marnus for his guidance during my second innings, and I&#39;m pleased I could play my part. Steve&#39;s batting was remarkable - considering we won the toss and faced challenging conditions on day one, posting a total in the high 400s was a fantastic achievement.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Our batting strategy was deliberately focused on eliminating any possibility of an Indian victory. With a comfortable run cushion, we maximized our opportunities to crowd the batsmen with close-in fielders. We&#39;ve invested significant effort in developing our lower-order batting skills, primarily focusing on understanding how to bowl effectively to opposition batters, but also ensuring we can contribute meaningful runs. The over rate situation influenced our decision to bring Travis in - we thought that might help us manage that aspect better.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Smith&#39;s performance was a masterclass in batting on this surface. His brilliant innings, combined with some crucial catches in the slips - something that often goes unnoticed - really showcased his value. There&#39;s a great feeling of satisfaction in the dressing room right now. We&#39;re going to take some time to enjoy this victory before shifting our focus to Sydney.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

With both teams having shown flashes of brilliance, the final Test promises to deliver a fitting climax.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Australia, under Pat Cummins, has been clinical after their initial setback in Perth. Their batting, led by the reliable Steven Smith and Marnus Labuschagne, has been complemented by a formidable bowling attack featuring Starc, Boland, and Lyon. The debut of Sam Konstas has added fresh energy to the squad, while Beau Webster&rsquo;s all-round contributions have further strengthened their lineup.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India will look to rediscover the form that brought them success in Perth.

Krishna&#39;s fierce spell injected brief hope - removing Smith on 9,999 Test runs and reducing Australia to 58/3 - but the target proved insufficient without Bumrah&#39;s services in the final innings.The series&#39; defining narrative emerges through contrasts: Bumrah&#39;s record 32 wickets stand tall amidst India&#39;s batting fragilities, and Australia&#39;s resilience after Perth defeat powers their 3-1 victory. From Adelaide&#39;s turnaround to Melbourne&#39;s dominance, culminating in Sydney&#39;s swift three-day finish on an unexpectedly spicy pitch.

I am immensely proud of how we bounced back after Perth, staying clear with our plans throughout. Using our entire squad proved crucial in a five-Test series - three debutants stepping up at different moments, especially Webster&#39;s magnificent debut here.The key to beating India was our senior players delivering in crucial moments, while maintaining adaptability with our plans. Special mention to Rohit and Bumrah - this series showcased Test cricket at its finest. And to end it on Jane McGrath Day in Sydney makes it even more meaningful.Will definitely go down as my favorite series to lead.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Cricket fans worldwide are eagerly awaiting the epic clash between India and England as they prepare for a thrilling five-match T20I series, starting January 22 at the iconic Eden Gardens. The action doesn&rsquo;t stop there, as a three-match ODI series will follow, serving as a prelude to the Champions Trophy.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Defending champions India, led by the electrifying Suryakumar Yadav, are riding high on their recent successes. The team has won every series since their triumphant T20 World Cup 2024 campaign, showcasing their brand of aggressive and fearless cricket&mdash;aptly called &quot;SKYball.&quot; With Suryakumar&rsquo;s innovative batting and a team built around attacking intent, India is looking to dominate on home soil. The return of veteran pacer Mohammed Shami adds a new dimension, strengthening their formidable squad.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>England, under new head coach Brendon McCullum, are introducing their bold &quot;Bazball&quot; philosophy to the shortest format. Led by the explosive Jos Buttler, the visitors boast a perfect blend of experience and youthful talent. This is England&rsquo;s first series in their new era, and they are determined to prove their mettle against the hosts.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>As both teams eye the T20 World Cup 2026 , co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, this series is more than just a bilateral contest. It&rsquo;s a stage for SKYball and Bazball to collide, showcasing two revolutionary cricketing styles. Will India&rsquo;s fearless SKYball dominate, or can England&rsquo;s daring Bazball reign supreme? Fans are bracing for a spectacle that promises unforgettable moments.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report by Deep Dasgupta and Nick Knight:</strong><br />\n<strong>&quot;The six-hitting festival begins today at the iconic Eden Gardens Stadium. Over the last two years, this venue has averaged 10 sixes per innings in T20 games, making it a paradise for big hitters. The dimensions are batter-friendly&mdash;59m and 66m square boundaries, with 75m straight down the ground.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The pitch has a nice tinge of green, though it&rsquo;s not overly green. It won&rsquo;t do much, but there will be enough in it for the bowlers early on. The tall England bowlers could extract some bounce and carry from the surface, which will be an advantage for them.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Traditionally, Eden Gardens is a high-scoring venue, and we expect plenty of runs today. The surface looks a bit drier and white-ish right now but will likely darken as the game progresses due to the dew factor. This means the ball will skid on, adding to the challenge for bowlers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>There&rsquo;s not much on offer for the spinners, as it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it will spin much. With more carry and pace, batters will look to dominate, and there will be pressure on the bowlers to execute their plans perfectly.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss Update:</strong> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and have opted to chase!&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakumar Yadav:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We will look to bowl first. The wicket looks a bit sticky, and there will be dew later on, which will make it heavier as the game progresses. The boys have been amazing, and the preparations have gone really well. We&rsquo;re looking forward to this series&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to be a great competition between both sides.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>It&rsquo;s a good headache to have, but we want to stick to our strengths and play to our game plan.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Jos Buttler:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;It looks like a good wicket, and we&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s going to be an exciting match. There will be some dew around, which might play a part later. This is a great ground, and it&rsquo;s always an honour to play against India in these conditions.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Everyone in the squad is in a good place, and it&rsquo;s nice to have the team together. With McCullum taking charge, his experience brings a lot to the group. It&rsquo;s going to be a challenge, but we&rsquo;re up for it. There&rsquo;s some incredible talent on both sides, which should make for a fantastic contest.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Saqib Mahmood, Brydon Carse, Jamie Smith, and Rehan Ahmed will miss out for this game.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1 - 6 Overs) :&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">ENG - 46/2 (7.66 rpo, 8x4, 0x6) </span>||<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"> </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 63/2 (10.50 rpo 7x4, 4x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Middle Overs (7 - 15 Overs) :&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">ENG - 53/4 (5.8 rpo, 3x4, 2x6)&nbsp;</span>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 70/1 (10.24 rpo 5x4, 5x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Death Overs (16 - 20 Overs) :&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">ENG - 33/4 (6.6 rpo, 2x4, 3x6)</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>India showcased their dominance with a commanding seven-wicket win over England in the opening T20I at Eden Gardens, taking a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. Put into bat first, England struggled to build momentum against a disciplined Indian bowling attack and were bowled out for 132. Jos Buttler was the standout performer for the visitors, playing a resilient knock of 68, but lacked support from the other end.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s bowling unit delivered an all-round performance, with Varun Chakaravarthy leading the way with a brilliant three-wicket haul. Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya, and Axar Patel complemented him well, each picking up two wickets to restrict England to a modest total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 133, India&rsquo;s batting lineup made light work of the target. Abhishek Sharma stole the show with a dazzling 79 off just 34 balls, playing an array of impressive shots to put India firmly in control. Sanju Samson provided solid support with a quickfire 26 off 20 deliveries, ensuring a smooth chase. The hosts crossed the finish line in just 12.5 overs, completing a thoroughly professional performance.<br />\n<br />\nJos Buttler&nbsp; (England Skipper):</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;There was a little bit in the wicket early on, and unfortunately, we lost a couple of wickets. Jofra (Archer) always looks good&mdash;he&rsquo;s an absolute superstar. Watching him and Wood operate together is really exciting; they bring so much to the team.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">From venue to venue, it&rsquo;s crucial to assess the conditions quickly and adapt your game accordingly. Personally, I&rsquo;m really enjoying the environment within the team. I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan of Brendon McCullum, and it&rsquo;s fantastic to be working with him. His approach and insights have been invaluable.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakumar Yadav (India Skipper):</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;The energy after winning the toss set the benchmark for the game. The bowlers had clear plans and executed them brilliantly, and the way we batted was the icing on the cake.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">We followed a similar approach to what we did in South Africa, where Hardik took responsibility with the new ball, giving us the cushion to play the extra spinner. Varun&#39;s preparations have been spot-on, and Arshdeep has stepped up by taking extra responsibility, which is great to see.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">There&rsquo;s a lot of freedom within the team, and we want to play a bit differently, pushing boundaries to improve. Fielding has been a key focus for us&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been working really hard on it. Taking those half-chances and making a difference in the field can be crucial in tight games.&quot;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Varun Chakaravarthy (Player of the Match):</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I&#39;m quite used to seeing such pitches during the IPL, so I had a fair idea of what lengths would work for me. My focus was on keeping the ball away from the batters&#39; arc to make it harder for them.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Bowling at Eden Gardens is always challenging, especially with every over bringing a new test. The last over, in particular, was very tough, but by God&#39;s grace, I managed to pull it off.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I can&#39;t rely on side spin to beat the batsmen&mdash;bounce is my primary weapon. That&rsquo;s what I try to use to my advantage. I&rsquo;d rate myself a 7 out of 10 at the moment; there&rsquo;s still more work to do, and I&rsquo;m committed to improving further.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The cricketing carnival rolls into Chennai as the iconic MA Chidambaram Stadium gets ready to host the second T20I between India and England on January 25, 2025. With the series tantalizingly poised, the hosts are eyeing a 2-0 lead, while the visitors are desperate to bounce back and restore parity.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India, riding high on confidence after a comprehensive seven-wicket win in the series opener, look unstoppable. Abhishek Sharma dazzled in the first game with an unforgettable 34-ball 79, tearing apart England&rsquo;s bowlers and finishing the chase with an astonishing 43 balls to spare. Backed by Varun Chakravarthy&rsquo;s spellbinding three-wicket haul and a flawless display from the bowling unit, India showcased their SKYball brand of cricket to perfection. Now, with the vibrant Chennai crowd behind them, they&rsquo;ll aim to tighten their grip on the series and march toward a dominant 2-0 lead.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>England, however, will not go down without a fight. Jos Buttler&rsquo;s valiant 68 and Jofra Archer&rsquo;s fiery spell were bright sparks in an otherwise forgettable outing for the visitors in Kolkata. Brendon McCullum&rsquo;s men will need their Bazball spirit to fire on all cylinders if they are to overcome a rampaging Indian side in their own backyard.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The battle lines are drawn. Can India deliver another masterclass and delight their home fans, or will England rise from the ashes and level the series? One thing is certain&mdash;Chennai is about to witness a cricketing spectacle for the ages!<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report by Deep Dasgupta and Nick Knight:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Chennai hosts its first T20I in nearly seven years on a surface that promises compelling cricket. The venue features moderate boundaries - around 67m square and 75m straight - providing balanced dimensions for both batters and bowlers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The black soil pitch shows some surface cracks but maintains a protective grass layer. While pacers will find decent purchase hitting the deck, spinners can expect workable bounce without excessive turn. The surface should favor batting initially but might lose some pace as the game progresses.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Given these conditions and minimal dew expectations, a target around 180 appears competitive. The ground&#39;s characteristics suggest an even contest between bat and ball, though batters might hold a slight advantage in the early stages.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss Update</strong>: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and will be chasing!&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Surya Kunar Yadav:</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot; We are going to bowl first.&nbsp;The surface looks promising, and we&#39;re anticipating even better conditions under lights. Our focus remains on executing the fundamentals well. Can&#39;t wait to get started. Team spirit really shows in our fielding efforts. Regarding team updates: We&#39;ll be missing Nitish, while Rinku is unavailable for a couple of matches. We&#39;re bringing Washington and Dhruv into the lineup.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Jos Buttler:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We also preferred to bowl first. Our game strategy remains consistent - we&#39;re just aiming for better execution. Looking forward to good batting conditions. Two changes: Smith replaces the unwell Bethell, and Carse comes in for Atkinson.</strong>&quot;</span></p>\n",

Tilak Varma emerged as the hero of the night with a gritty unbeaten 72 off 55 balls, guiding the hosts to a challenging target of 166 on a tricky Chennai wicket.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Opting to bowl first, India&rsquo;s bowlers once again delivered a disciplined performance, restricting England to 165/9 in their 20 overs. Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel were the standout performers with two wickets apiece, applying the brakes on England&rsquo;s scoring. Jos Buttler anchored the innings with a crucial 45, while late fireworks from Brydon Carse and Jamie Smith added valuable runs to push England to a competitive total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing 166, India&rsquo;s top order faltered on a surface offering assistance to the bowlers. However, Tilak Varma held his nerve, constructing a mature knock under pressure. Down the order, Washington Sundar chipped in with a crucial 26, adding vital runs in a tense chase. For England, Brydon Carse was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with impressive figures of 3/29, but his efforts weren&rsquo;t enough to prevent India from crossing the line.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With this hard-fought victory, India now leads the series 2-0. England will need to regroup quickly to stay alive in the contest as the series heads to its third game.<br />\n<br />\nJos Buttler (England Skipper)<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;Really competitive match. Full credit to Tilak&#39;s match-winning performance. Our aggressive approach created opportunities, kept them under pressure. Very satisfied with our batting intent - despite losing wickets, we maintained our attacking style. Jamie Smith&#39;s innings was outstanding. While there&#39;s room for improvement, we&#39;re committed to this approach.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakymar Yadav (Indian Skipper)<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Target of 160 felt competitive and our bowling executed well. The extra batting depth who can bowl has worked for us. While we play aggressively, today&#39;s situation required smart batting - really impressed with Tilak&#39;s knock. Bishnoi and Arshdeep&#39;s batting contributions show their practice is paying off. Team&#39;s on the same page with our goals and approach, which is key to our success.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tilak Varma (Player of The Match)<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;On this two-paced wicket, I adapted my game following Gautam sir&#39;s advice about situational batting. The left-right combination with Bishnoi worked well, making it tricky for bowlers. Our South Africa experience and net practice prepared us well. I just told Bishnoi to maintain his shape and find gaps.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

With India leading 2-0, thanks to a miraculous chase in Chennai led by Tilak Varma&#39;s unbeaten 72, England faces a do-or-die situation to prevent a series defeat.Rajkot&rsquo;s batting-friendly surface, often compared to a highway, sets the stage for a potential run-fest. Dew is expected to play a crucial role, making the toss vital for both teams. India&#39;s fearless approach under skipper Suryakumar Yadav has been the hallmark of their success, with players like Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma stepping up in pressure situations. Meanwhile, Varun Chakaravarthy and Axar Patel have consistently troubled England&rsquo;s batting order with their spin wizardry.For England, Jos Buttler remains the key to their batting fortunes, with support needed from the likes of Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse. Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, despite their pace, need to maintain discipline to contain India&rsquo;s in-form batters.India will aim to seal the series with two games to spare and continue their dominant run in T20Is.

I&rsquo;m always prepared for any situation, whether it&rsquo;s bowling four overs on the trot or adapting to different roles.I&rsquo;ve been working on my flipper, and it&rsquo;s coming out well.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>England&rsquo;s thumping win in Rajkot has thrown this five-match T20I series wide open. Trailing 0-2 initially, Jos Buttler&rsquo;s side bounced back with aggressive short-pitched bowling, unsettling India&rsquo;s top order and proving there&rsquo;s more to their game than just big hitting. The visitors now eye another victory to force a decider.For India, spin remains the trump card. Varun Chakravarthy has been sensational, bagging wickets in clusters and tying batters in knots. Ravi Bishnoi and Washington Sundar have supported him ably, leaving England&rsquo;s batting under constant pressure. However, the hosts might reconsider fielding an additional seamer after their pace department struggled last time out.In the batting department, Suryakumar Yadav is seeking a return to form, while Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma continue to impress. Rinku Singh&rsquo;s return from injury could bolster the lower order, and Arshdeep Singh might be recalled to add sting to India&rsquo;s attack.Pune&rsquo;s pitch has historically rewarded teams batting first, so the toss might again prove decisive. With momentum swinging England&rsquo;s way and India holding a 2-1 lead, the fourth T20I promises a gripping contest. Can England level the series, or will India spin their way to a match-winning result? All eyes turn to Pune for the answer.<br />\n<br />\nToss Update:-<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"> England Won the toss and decided to field first!</span><br />\n<br />\nJos Buttler:</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;We&rsquo;ve decided to bowl first tonight. The atmosphere here is incredible, and the series is nicely poised. We&rsquo;re pleased with our previous performance, though there&rsquo;s still room for improvement. As for the target, I&rsquo;m a bit uncertain because the dew might come into play. We&rsquo;re making two changes to our lineup&mdash;Mahmood replaces Wood, and Bethell comes in for Smith.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Suryakumar Yadav:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&ldquo;Our focus is on delivering a solid brand of cricket while sticking to the fundamentals. We&rsquo;ve put the Rajkot game behind us and aim to entertain these supporters. The pitch looks a bit dry, so we&rsquo;ll aim to set a challenging total and defend it. As for the changes, Arshdeep replaces Shami, Rinku comes in for Jurel, and Shivam Dube brings some added firepower in place of Washington Sundar.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n",

A spirited all-round performance saw Shivam Dube (53 off 34) and Hardik Pandya (53 off 30) propel India to 181/9, despite an early top-order collapse. Saqib Mahmood (3/35) and Jamie Overton (2/32) were England&rsquo;s standout bowlers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Ben Duckett (39 off 19) and Harry Brook (51 off 26) kept England in the chase, but India&rsquo;s bowlers stepped up at crucial moments. Ravi Bishnoi (3/28) and Varun Chakravarthy (2/28) troubled the batters, while debutant Harshit Rana, brought in as a concussion substitute, made an immediate impact with 3/33, dismissing Livingstone, Bethell, and Overton.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite late efforts from Overton (19) and Rashid (10),* England fell short, getting bowled out for 166 in 19.4 overs. With this victory, India head to Mumbai with the series in the bag, showcasing depth in both batting and bowling. Rana&rsquo;s dream debut added to the memorable night for India, marking a fitting end to the series battle!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jos Buttler&nbsp; | England Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We started brilliantly, taking wickets early and then capitalizing in the batting powerplay. We were in a great position and should have closed out the game. It&rsquo;s disappointing&mdash;we did a lot of good things, but key moments cost us. I dropped Dube on his first ball, and he went on to play a brilliant knock. With the bat, we were in control but lost wickets too quickly. We need to stay committed to our aggressive approach&mdash;if we back ourselves more, we&rsquo;ll win plenty of games.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match: Shivam Dube&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSuryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;A fantastic effort from everyone in the field. The crowd was incredible, backing us from start to finish&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without them. Losing three wickets early wasn&rsquo;t ideal, but the boys knew the cricket we wanted to play. The way Hardik and Dube batted was outstanding. We&rsquo;ve been encouraging players to express themselves and bat as they do in the nets, and I&rsquo;m pleased we&rsquo;re heading in the right direction. After the powerplay, I felt we could control the game between overs 7-10. Post the drinks break, Dube couldn&rsquo;t return, and Harshit Rana stepped in as a third seamer&mdash;he delivered brilliantly for us.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

England&rsquo;s speedsters&mdash;Saqib Mahmood, Mark Wood, and Jofra Archer&mdash;have rattled India&rsquo;s top order on multiple occasions.

England&rsquo;s valiant chase of 248 turned into a nightmare as they were bowled out for just 97 in 10.3 overs, marking India&rsquo;s second-biggest T20I win by run margin.The standout performance came from Abhishek Sharma, who blasted an astonishing 135 off 54 balls, featuring 13 sixes&mdash;the most sixes by an Indian in a T20I and the highest individual score for India in the format. His explosive innings set the tone for the evening.India&rsquo;s bowlers were equally impressive. Mohammed Shami took 3/25, Varun Chakravarthy claimed 2/25, and Shivam Dube secured 2/11, collectively ensuring that England&rsquo;s batsmen had no answer to their relentless pressure. Although Phil Salt scored a brisk 55 off 23, his efforts couldn&rsquo;t stave off the collapse of the rest of the lineup. This emphatic victory not only sealed the series but also underscored India&#39;s dominance in the T20 format, leaving fans in awe of their performance.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jos Buttler |&nbsp; England Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;re disappointed to lose the series, but there were some bright moments. We&#39;ve done well in parts, and now we know exactly where to improve. It&rsquo;s all about sticking to the style of cricket we believe in.There were positives from both sides, and credit to India&mdash;they&rsquo;re a fantastic team at home. Our lads will only get better from this experience, and we&#39;ll continue to strive for improvement.I must highlight the bowling efforts today&mdash;Mark Wood and Brydon Carse were exceptional. And I have to say, Abhishek Sharma&rsquo;s innings was one of the finest pieces of cricket I&#39;ve seen.On a personal note, I&#39;m looking forward to the ODIs, although it seems like T20s are calling us back more often these days. We&rsquo;re excited to see what comes next.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;Abhishek Sharma |&nbsp;Player of the Match :</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Playing for my country is always a special feeling. When I know it&#39;s my day, I try to make an impact right from the first ball. The support from the coach and captain since day one has meant a lot&mdash;they&rsquo;ve always encouraged this kind of intent and trusted me to deliver. Facing bowlers who can clock 140, 150-plus, you have to be ready early; you simply need to react quickly and play your shots. Hitting a world-class bowler over the covers is always a thrill, and I enjoyed the shots I played against Adil Rashid too. I&rsquo;m sure my mentor, Yuvraj Singh, would be happy today. He&rsquo;s always pushed me to bat deep into the innings&mdash;into the 15th or 20th over&mdash;and I made sure to implement that.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Varun Chakaravarthy |&nbsp; Player of the Series:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I&#39;m thrilled that our fielding earned some well-deserved applause. The team has focused on elevating our fielding standards, and I&#39;ve been working hard alongside our fielding coach, Mr. Dilip. I believe this is the best I&#39;ve bowled so far, though there&#39;s still plenty of room for improvement. I regret a few loose deliveries; it was all about bowling the right ball at the right moment, and that&#39;s what I aimed for today. This achievement is very special to me&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to dedicate it to my son, my wife, and my parents. I also want to thank Surya and GG for their unwavering support.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s all about trusting your instincts on the field. When you feel like you can take a wicket, just deliver the ball. Our guys work tirelessly in the nets, and their dedication really shows on match day&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with their efforts. We discussed this in our team meeting: we&rsquo;re committed to playing an innovative brand of cricket, regardless of the result. Sure, it comes with risks, but that&rsquo;s the game. It&rsquo;s always great to see someone bat at the top like that&mdash;I&rsquo;m delighted for him and his family; I&rsquo;m sure they enjoyed the innings just as much as we did. As for Varun Chakravarthy, I was half-expecting him to mention his fielding (laughs). He&rsquo;s been working relentlessly with Dilip Sir, always making time to hone his skills. When it comes to his bowling, he&rsquo;s incredibly process-oriented, and I&rsquo;m extremely proud of his progress.&quot;Ultimately, it&rsquo;s the collective effort on the field that injects extra energy into the team&mdash;whether through batting or bowling&mdash;and that&rsquo;s exactly what I expect from everyone. They never disappoint.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Kohli, needing 94 runs to breach the 14,000-run mark, will be a focal point.

It&rsquo;s great to have Joe Root back&mdash;his experience adds strength to our side. The team morale is high, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to the challenge ahead. Facing India in these conditions is a tough test, but it&rsquo;s the perfect preparation for the Champions Trophy. We&rsquo;ve gone with three seamers today and are ready for the battle.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rohit Sharma&nbsp; | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We would have bowled first, but regardless of the toss, it&#39;s about executing our plans. Now that we&#39;re bowling first, we aim to start aggressively and set the tone early. It&rsquo;s good to be back after a break, it&#39;s time to reflect and refocus. This series is a great opportunity to fine-tune our game ahead of the Champions Trophy, especially since we haven&#39;t played much ODI cricket since the World Cup. Jaiswal and Harshit make their debuts today, which is exciting. Unfortunately, Virat misses out due to a knee injury.

Despite early blows at 19/2, Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer counter-attacked brilliantly, dismantling England&rsquo;s bowling. Axar Patel added the finishing touches, ensuring a comfortable chase. Earlier, England&rsquo;s 248 all out was shaped by Phil Salt, Jos Buttler , and Jacob Bethell, but India&rsquo;s bowlers, led by Ravindra Jadeja (3/26) and Harshit Rana (3/53), kept them in check. England&rsquo;s bowlers struggled for consistency, with Adil Rashid (2/49) and Saqib Mahmood (2/47) offering some resistance, but India&rsquo;s calculated aggression proved too strong.

We started well but lost four quick wickets, which hurt us. Another 40-50 runs could have made a big difference, considering how the pitch played later.This isn&#39;t the brand of cricket we want to play&mdash;we aim to sustain pressure and momentum, which we haven&rsquo;t managed consistently, both in the T20s and today.That said, we began well with the ball, reducing them to 30/2, but credit to Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer for their partnership.Going forward, we need to sustain our good phases for longer. When we have momentum, we must capitalize on it.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:</strong>&nbsp;<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Pretty happy with the win. Coming back to this format after a long time, it was crucial to regroup quickly and understand our roles. I thought we executed well from the start. Their openers got off to a strong start, but we made a solid comeback.In ODIs, there&#39;s always a chance to bounce back. Momentum will shift, but having the skillset to regain control is key. Credit to our bowlers for pulling things back brilliantly, and we were sharp in the field as well.We wanted a left-hander in the middle order to take on their spinners, and Axar has consistently delivered with the bat. His partnership with Shreyas was crucial, and I&rsquo;m really happy with his performance.No specific takeaways&mdash;just want the team to keep doing the right things and ticking as many boxes as possible. We executed well today, though ideally, we shouldn&#39;t have lost so many wickets at the backend. But the intent to put pressure on the opposition was there, and that&rsquo;s important.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shubman Gill | Player Of The Match:</strong><br />\n&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Just focus on being positive. There was some movement for the pacers with the new ball, so the plan was to stay on the front foot and play good cricketing shots. Having a player like Shreyas come in and take the game on put the opposition under pressure, which helped me as well. It was a great decision, and he played brilliantly. My favourite shot was the pull towards mid-wicket when I was in the 70s. The spinners were getting some turns, and for pacers, some deliveries were sticking while others came on nicely. Our plan was to target scoring square off the wicket .Not much changes in batting, but on the field, I try to observe Rohit bhai, how he reads the game, and share any suggestions when needed.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>After a convincing win in the first ODI, India will look to seal the series against England in the second match at Cuttack. The hosts are riding high on confidence, and the return of Virat Kohli is expected to bolster their attack. Harshit Rana made a memorable debut in the first game, claiming three wickets, while Ravindra Jadeja reached a milestone of 600 international wickets. Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, and Axar Patel also impressed with half-centuries, helping India chase down the target in 38.4 overs. England, on the other hand, has plenty to ponder ahead of the Champions Trophy. The visitors need their big batters to step up and deliver. Jos Buttler and Jacob Bethell showed promise with the bat, while Adil Rashid continued to impress with the ball. With the series on the line, the stakes cannot be higher. Will India wrap up the series with a 2-0 lead, or will England&#39;s &quot;Bazballers&quot; bounce back to level the series? The stage is set for a thrilling contest at Cuttack.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report :</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Deep Dasgupta and Graeme Swann: This is a high-scoring ground. 63 and 64m square boundaries and 73m hit down the ground. I will do a tap test, it&rsquo;s not as hard as the last pitch we played at and it&#39;s cracked so it might turn a bit in the last few overs. I think the ball will come on to bat nicely during the day. It might slow down in the later part of the first innings. You would want to bowl first and there might be a bit of dew later on as the game progresses.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>TOSS : ENGLAND WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO BAT FIRST!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma (India Skipper):&quot; We put in a solid performance in the first match, which stood out for me. The enthusiasm was excellent, especially considering we hadn&rsquo;t been on the field for a while. It was fantastic to witness, particularly after losing two early wickets. Shreyas takes great pride in his aggression and mindset, and we can&rsquo;t overlook the important contributions from Shubman and Axar either. As for the pitch, it&rsquo;s black soil, so I&rsquo;m not entirely certain, but I anticipate it could play on the slower&nbsp;side. We&rsquo;ve made two changes,&nbsp;Jaiswal steps aside for Virat, and with Kuldeep being rested, Varun earns his maiden cap.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler(England Skipper):&quot; We&rsquo;ve decided to set a target today. The team has been progressing well, looking to sustain consistent performances for longer periods, and we&rsquo;re hoping for a successful outing. The pitch appears a bit arid, composed of black soil, but overall, it looks like a reliable surface for batting. We&rsquo;ve made three adjustments to our lineup&mdash;Mark Wood, Gus Atkinson, and Jamie Overton have been included in the XI.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>VARUN CHAKARAVARTHY IS THE SECOND OLDEST PLAYER TO MAKE A DEBUT FOR INDIA. THE FIRST ONE IS FAROKH ENGINEER.</strong></span></p>\n",

The duo stitched an 81-run opening stand before India&#39;s debutant Varun Chakaravarthy struck to remove Salt. Duckett looked in good rhythm, reaching his fifty, but failed to carry on, departing for 69. Harry Brook and Jos Buttler got starts but couldn&#39;t capitalize, with Harshit Rana and Ravindra Jadeja striking at crucial moments. Late cameos from Liam Livingstone (41 off 32) and Adil Rashid (14 off 5) helped England cross the 300 run mark, setting up a competitive total. Jadeja was the standout performer with the ball, finishing with 3 for 35, while Shami, Rana, Pandya, and Chakaravarthy chipped in with a wicket each. India&rsquo;s reply was commanding, as Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill provided a solid foundation with a 136-run opening stand. Gill played fluently, scoring 60, before falling against the run of play. However, Rohit made the most of his start, smashing a 75-ball century&mdash;his 32nd in ODIs! Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja held their nerve to take India over the line with 5.3 overs to spare, sealing the series in style! For England, Jamie Overton picked up two wickets, while Atkinson, Rashid, and Livingstone claimed one each. However, their efforts weren&rsquo;t enough to stop India from securing the series victory.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Jos Buttler, England Skipper: &quot;We did a lot of things well. We got into a good position with the bat. We needed someone to push on and get to 350. Rohit batted superbly, credits to him. It was Important to get runs on the board, it skidded on and the opposition played well. We played the powerplay nicely, but we needed a score of around 350 which would have been defendable. Just keep making steps in the right direction, the results are not there but we need to keep going and be positive.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma (POTM &amp; Indian Skipper): &quot;Felt great to be out there, contributing with runs in a crucial game with the series at stake. I approached my innings in phases, planning how I wanted to build it. This format sits between T20s and Tests&mdash;you still need to read the conditions and adapt accordingly. On black soil pitches, the ball tends to skid, so showing the full face of the bat becomes important. Their bowlers were aiming at the body, cutting down width, so I had to adjust my strategy. I focused on picking the gaps, and having solid partnerships with Gill and Shreyas helped. We enjoy batting together and Gill is a technically gifted player. I&rsquo;ve watched him closely, and he remains unfazed by pressure. His numbers speak for themselves. Managing the middle overs is key games can shift either way during that phase. If you control that period well, it reduces pressure at the back end. In both matches, including Nagpur, we tightened things in the middle, which worked in our way. As a team, we are always looking to improve, both collectively and individually, and we&rsquo;ll continue striving for that.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India and England are set to clash in the third and final ODI at the Narendra Modi Stadium on February 12, marking their last international fixture before the highly anticipated Champions Trophy 2025.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>With the series already in the bag, India will look to experiment with their playing XI while maintaining their winning momentum. Rohit Sharma&rsquo;s return to form has strengthened the batting lineup, while Shubman Gill continues to dominate in his favored format. The hosts are high on confidence and will be eager to complete a clean sweep against the visitors.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>England, on the other hand, will be desperate to end the series on a high and take some positives into the Champions Trophy. Their batting unit showed improvement in the second ODI, with Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Jos Buttler, and Liam Livingstone making valuable contributions. However, the absence of Jacob Bethell due to injury is a major setback, and their bowling attack needs to step up if they are to challenge India.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>With India aiming for a 3-0 whitewash and England fighting to restore some pride, the stage is set for an exciting finale in Ahmedabad. Can England turn things around, or will India seal a dominant victory?<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The surface is right in the center, with 66m boundaries square and 74m straight down the ground. This is the same black soil pitch that hosted the World Cup final. Historically, it played slow in the first half but improved for batting as the game progressed.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the hessian cover has just been removed, leaving some moisture on the surface, but with time left before play, it should dry out. There are visible cracks, which could keep the bowlers interested.</p>\n\n<p>Looks like a bowl-first wicket, where set batters can capitalize, but newcomers might find it tricky early on. Dew could be a factor, as there was significant moisture last night&mdash;something teams will need to consider. Expert views from Deep Dasgupta and Graeme Swann.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss Update</strong>:-<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong> England won the toss and opted to field first!</strong></span>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Jos Buttler:-</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;We are going to <strong>bowl first</strong> today. There might be <strong>some turn later</strong>, but we wanted to switch things up after batting first in the first two games. It&rsquo;s a good chance to experience <strong>a different challenge</strong>, especially with the <strong>Champions Trophy</strong> ahead. The surface looks <strong>decent</strong>, and we have played here before, including against <strong>New Zealand in the World Cup</strong> a few years ago.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rohit Sharma:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I wanted to bat first and put runs on the board since we bowled first in the last two games.
