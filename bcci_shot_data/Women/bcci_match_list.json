Despite a rapid start, India scalped 3 big wickets of Sophie Devine, Suzie Bates and skipper Amy Satterthwaite within the first 10 overs. Amelia Kerr and Maddy Green then combined for a century stand, before the former brought up a fine hundred and remained unbeaten on 119 to guide the hosts home along with sister Jess Kerr. Earlier, after opting to bat first, it was a&nbsp;solid effort with the willow from India as they put on 270/6 in their 50 overs. Opening pair of Shafali Verma and S Meghana got the visitors off to an aggressive start, as the latter fell just short of a well-deserved maiden WODI half-century. Yastika Bhatia played her shots in a breezy innings, and then it was then the experienced Mithali Raj and young Richa Ghosh, both scoring 50s, who set the tone with a splendid century stand through the middle phase.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Amelia Kerr is the Player of the Match.</strong></p>",

Nice to guide the side home with the series win on the line. Great to see right across the series different people contributing. We didn't really feel pressure, at 152 for 4, we backed our batting order and talked about keeping it simple, taking the ones and twos, and trying to put the bad balls away. They (India) are a really quality side and they've got better with every game\"</p><p><span style=\"color:#3498db\"><strong>Mithali Raj, Captain, India: </strong></span>\"We did not get the partnerships through the middle, Deepti's innings got us to 280. Every game the batting unit has been doing very well, there are a lot of areas we need to work on as a fielding unit.\"</p><p><strong>Sophie Devine, Captain, New Zealand</strong>: \"The cricket we have played over the last 3 games has been outstanding. Our challenge is now to continue. The way the batters handled the run chase was pleasing, at times things could have gotten away from us but the way Lauren Down and Frankie Mackay played were outstanding at the end, Amelia Kerr, Amy Satterthwaite, you could talk about all the batters. The way the team has grown over the last couple of years is that we don't get too nervous chasing big totals. We set ourselves very high standards, after their start to keep them under 300 was very good. Consistency is something we have screamed for, just need to tidy up few things. The way the team went about the chase was outstanding. We will reflect and celebrate, we should be very proud\"</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

I've done a lot of work through the winter on my batting, got trained as hard and as similar as I can to a game, had the opportunity to bat a lot, good preparation heading into the summer.

With this open ground, breeze, there are spells when bowlers bowl well but we have not been consistent. I was just looking at the shots Richa was playing, the way she had gone about her batting today, she is very talented and has a bright future for India.\"</p><p><strong>Sophie Devine, Captain, New Zealand</strong>: \"Complete performance from us, showed real intent in a shortened game, the way the batters went out there and played to their strengths, fielding is the area where we have missed fair few runs, with bowling, there are times where we have been slow to change our plans at times. Certainly had belief in this group, the way these girls have trained in the last couple of years, results may not have gone our way, but we are seeing results now, and with the World Cup around the corner it's real confidence.\"</p><div>\u00a0</div><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

I try to keep the same processes, play the ball on its merit, with the ball get the back leg through and keep the flight when I bowl best. I don't think it's tough batting and bowling, I've done it as a kid, now at the international level it's about doing the same, for me it's all about being competitive. I think we are heading in the right direction, we have belief as a group and that's very important.

Fifties from Amy Satterthwaite and Amelia Kerr helped New Zealand post 260 on board, and a brilliant display of pace bowling from Lea Tahuhu helped pile on the pressure for the Indians. Pooja Vastrakar starred with the ball for India picking up 4 wickets, and Harmanpreet Kaur played a fighting knock but it was too much of a task for her. India clash against West Indies on the 12th of March in their next encounter of the World Cup. Catch us then!<br /><br /><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mithali Raj, India captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I think after those early wickets, they got a good partnership going and it seemed like 280 would be on the cards. But we did well to pull things back at the end. It was a chaseable score, provided the top order managed the run rate properly. We needed one of the batters to bat deep. There was a lot of extra bounce under lights, nothing unplayable but we could have done better. The batting needs to get better.\"<br /><br /><strong>Sophie Devine, New Zealand captain:</strong>&nbsp;\"It was a complete performance. We built partnerships throughout, Amelia Kerr and Amy Satterthwaite batted beautifully. The bowling was outstanding, just didn't give them anything at all. We've got variety and options with our attack and it allows us to be flexible. Today was a more complete performance and hope we can carry it forward to the next game.\"<br /><br /><strong>Amy Satterthwaite is the Player of the Match.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Amy Satterthwaite</strong>: \"We wanted to take it as deep as we could, set up a platform from where we could launch. We probably didn't quite do as we would've liked to but in the end it was enough. If I walk off playing the way I want to, regardless of how it went, I can accept that. The timing was there in patches and the bowlers were outstanding, the first 20-odd overs were exceptional, we talked about our starts and we couldn't have asked for anything more.\"</p>",

This will be India's third game of the World Cup, having won one and lost one so far. Mithali Raj's side began the tournament with a win over Pakistan, and despite Harmanpreet Kaur's fighting half-century, New Zealand prevailed over India in their second game. West Indies have begun the tournament strongly, with two wins from two. Indian skipper Mithali Raj adds another feather to her cap, with the record of most women's world cup matches as Captain.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TOSS: India won the toss and elect to bat first. Both sides remain unchanged from their previous game.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Playing XI:</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India:&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>S Mandhana, Y Bhatia, D Sharma, M Raj (c), H Kaur, R Ghosh (wk), S Rana, P Vastrakar, J Goswami, M Singh, R Gayakwad</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">West Indies</span>:&nbsp;D Dottin, H Matthews, K Knight, S Taylor (c), S Campbelle (wk), C Nation, C Henry, A Alleyne, A Mohammed, S Selman, S Connell</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p>",

A blazing start in the chase from Deandra Dottin and Hayley Matthews put India on the backfoot initially, but once the partnership was broken by Sneh Rana, India never let the Windies batters settle. A good all-round effort with the ball was backed up by some excellent fielding, and West Indies were eventually bowled out for 162. Sneh Rana picked up 3/22, while Meghna Singh scalped 2 wickets, Pooja Vastrakar, Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Jhulan Goswami took a wicket each. Jhulan Goswami also became the leading wicket-taker in ICC Women's Cricket World Cup with 40 scalps to her name. Earlier, after opting to bat first, Yastika Bhatia provided an explosive start, after which Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur scored magnificent tons to power India to 317/8.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Smriti Mandhana is named the Player of the Match.</strong></p><p><strong>Smriti Mandhana:</strong> \" I think scoring a century and not being named player of the match is not something I want, we (Harmanpreet Kaur) both contributed equally, we both are good enough contenders to get it.As a batter, toss is not going to go your way. Last match we did not get going, we learnt from our mistakes, wanted to carry momentum through the 50 overs. We both like chasing and setting target equally.Our strengths are different, she is really good with spin, and I like pace.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur: </strong>I think set-batter was there this time, last game no one was there to support me,&nbsp; was also confident about my batting, we were looking for singles and doubles, and looking for boundaries and we were able to do that. Our left and right combination is good.</p><p><strong>Stafanie Taylor, Captain, West Indies</strong>: \" I don't think we bowled the way we wanted to, did not execute. Gave away too many short balls. I thought Harman and Smriti batted really well. The start they (the openers) gave us was brilliant, it was important for one of them to stay there.</p><p><strong>Mithali Raj, Captain, India: \"</strong>Batting and bowling really came out well. Everyone knew the importance of today's game. It required a special effort, we knew West Indies came from 2 wins, we were playing after a big loss. The way Smriti and Harman played was very sensible and they have used their experience. It is good to have youngsters in the squad, they ease out the nerves by cracking a few jokes. Our approach for next games can be consistent.\"</p><div>\u00a0</div><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

When you lose you always think you are short on runs. Getting 200 could have had the match go either way. Every game we've done well as a fielding unit, it is a department where we have improved.

A bit scrappy in the end but getting over the line was important. The mentality of the girls was great, they went out there and were aggressive, it wasn't an easy wicket and a few more on the board would have been tricky, so I just wanted to be the one out there to finish.

For a long time, we've always banked on our spinners and we have quality spinners, and today's surface did help them a lot too. We haven't played a game in Christchurch yet, so that's a challenge.

We bowled well, put pressure on India at times but the batting needs to be worked upon. Controlling the nerves in crunch situations is something we need to learn. We didn't get enough partnerships in this game and also in the last match. That's what cost us the games. Bowlers did wonderfully well today, especially Salma and Ritu.

In domestic, I'd prepared for No. 3 and it was always in mind that whichever order I get, I'll have to contribute to the team so the preparation was according to that. Sometimes the wicket is not that good, so singles and strike rotation will be in my mind. It's my first Man of the Match in internationals, it really means a lot.\"</p>",

In reply,&nbsp;Laura Wolvaardt scored 80 off 79 and&nbsp;Mignon du Preez's&nbsp;&nbsp;52* off 63 helped South Africa seal the game in the last ball!

With the bowlers we had, I thought 275 was a good total, we had defended similar totals in the past. Jhulan Goswami&nbsp; experience would have added a lot, but this was an exposure for the other girls to step up. Everything should come to an end, it'll take time to settle the emotions, but that is sport. Thanks to everyone who turned out for every Indian game, it was nice to hear your cheers and keep supporting the girls and the Indian women's team in the future.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2ecc71\"><strong>Mignon du Preez - Player of the Match</strong></span>: \"I have been very fortunate, the girls have supported me throughout, I haven't had the best start to the tournament with the bat but to be able to do it today for us today was very special. The biggest thing was to take it deep. When I got in, there was still quite a few overs and we knew if we actually gave us some time, it'll get easier. Myself and Kapp said again we just need to take it as deep as possible because we know what Chloe can do. She hit a couple of boundaries. Knock means a lot, it's been a tough few weeks when I haven't contributed like I would have liked. To do it when it matters the most, getting the momentum right into the semifinal, I'll take it anytime of the week.&nbsp; We can't do it without you, thank you very much for all the support.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

After dismissing the openers back to back, the Indian bowlers came into play by taking wickets at regular intervals and dismissed all the other batters for single-digit scores. With the target of 126 runs to chase, the Indian openers started off well with Smriti Mandhana scoring 39 runs off 34 balls.

India lost an opener early but Shafali Verma kept the tempo high by playing in an aggressive manner and ended up scoring 43 of just 26 balls also being involved in a 70-run partnership with J Rodrigues. Rodrigues played the sheet anchor role to good effect making an unbeaten 56 of 43. Deepti Sharma who came into bat at no.6 provided the firepower at the end of the innings scoring 34* off 28 balls taking the Indian tally to 162. The bowling side of things was once again managed by Renuka Singh who was brilliant with the new ball scalping four wickets and conceding just 10 runs in her 4 overs. Half the Barbados side was back in the hut with just 34 runs on the board and it was a matter of time that other bowlers came to the party and ended things early. Indian team would be happy to end on this note and would love to carry the momentum in the next encounter which can seal a medal at the commonwealth games.&nbsp;</p>",

The Indian Team will be high on confidence after their successful campaign at the Commonwealth Games where the Women in Blue defeated England Women in the semi-finals. A lot will depend on how the senior players who have experience in English conditions perform in the series. Harmanpreet Kaur would be backing the side to succeed on foreign soil after a brief time of preparation over the last few weeks. The hosts on the other side have a few of their key players missing from their line up and Amy Jones is to take charge of the team. Both the teams have some exciting talent in their squads which means one can expect a thriller of a contest.</p><div>\u00a0</div><div><div><strong>TOSS:-</strong></div><div><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>England Women won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></div></div>",

It all started with India being sent in to bat with Smriti Mandhana providing a decent start along with Shefali Verma for the first four overs at the end of which Smith clinched the important wicket off Mandhana. After that, India found it a bit hard to find their way back into the game but the skipper, Harmanpreet Kaur did her best to lead from the front! She put up a good partnership with Ghosh, whose dismissal turned out to be the pivotal change after which India found it hard to recover in the death overs. But Deepti Sharma put up a hard-fought 29*(24), who was India's top scorer tonight, that helped India reach a respectable total of 132/7. Dunkley and Wyatt provided England a flying start. Sneh Rana did provide India the breakthrough but Dunkley and Capsey did turn out to be too good for the Indian bowlers today, as England cruised to their victory. England leads the series 1-0.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Captain:</strong>&nbsp;</span> \"We were not able to get the runs we were expecting.

You need to have teammates that play in whatever conditions. It was not 100% condition, the ground was too wet and there were chances of getting injured. And one of our fielders got injured and we turned out one bowler short.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Amy Jones, England Captain:</span></strong> \"It is important to start well and the girls did that. We kept them to a good score. The pitch was a bit skiddy and we had to play straight. Danni at the start was great, Dunks played confidently as well. It is an unbelievable top three with the form they are in.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sarah Glenn is the player of the match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sarah Glenn: </strong></span>\"I thought we did very well as a unit.

It was England Women that got the better of the Women in Blue in the previous encounter at Chester-le-street. Team India was restricted to a total of 132 after being asked to bat first courtesy of some brilliant bowling display from the Leg spinner Sarah Glenn who went on to scalp four wickets in her four over spell. Deepti Sharma's unbeaten 29 of 24 was the top score for Team India. In reply, the English Team got off to a flying start amassing 60 runs in the powerplay and thereafter the Indian Team could not come back in the game. Sophia Dunkley's 61* of 44 and Alice Capsey's 32 of 20 balls sealed the game for the hosts. The Indian team would look to bounce back in the second game to keep the series alive.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>England Women won the toss and elected to Bat first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Amy Jones, England Captain: \"</strong></span>We've had some good success here batting first.I don't think the wicket will change much so want to get going.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Captain:</strong></span> \"We were looking to bowl anyway. \"It's an opportunity for us.

Some brilliance in the field from Radha Yadav resulted in a crucial run out at a crucial time in the game. Thereafter, it was Sneh Rana who ran through the England middle order which meant that the hosts could manage only 142 from their 20 overs. The off-spinner accounted for three wickets in her four over spell. In response, the opening pair of Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma came out all guns blazing taking the England bowlers to the cleaners. The duo added 55 runs in the powerplay to put Team India in the driver's seat. Mandhana remained unbeaten on 79 of just 53 balls taking the team home in style.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the third T20 International between India and England at Bristol, UK. The hosts won the series opener comprehensively while the Women in Blue came back in emphatic fashion in the second game of the series. Smriti Mandhana's knock of 79* runs of 53 balls took India home by 8 wickets in the 17th over of the match. The momentum is with the Indian side and the chance to register their first T20 series win in England would also be at the back of their heads. It will be an exciting contest against a young and competent English side which has shown a lot of promise in absence of some key players.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Toss:</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">England Women won the toss and elected to field first.</span></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Amy Jones, England Captain: </strong></span>\"It didn't matter too much but we did think the dew had a little effect in the last game.

The Indian Top order was back in the pavilion by the end of the powerplay with just 20 on board. The first half of the first innings belonged to the bowling side. Thereafter, there was a counterattack from Deepti Sharma, Richa Ghosh and Pooja Vastrakar which helped India get to a respectable total of 122. Richa Ghosh was the top scorer with 33 runs of just 22 balls. In reply, the English batters played cautiously stitching together a 70 run opening stand. The Indian team did manage to come back in the game courtesy of Radha Yadav who conceded just 14 runs in her four-over spell also picking up the wicket of the England Skipper Amy Jones. But, the Inform batter Alice Capsey along with Bryony Smith took the team home with 10 balls to spare.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Captain</strong></span>: \"I think we were 20 run short and we need to give credit to our bowlers because of whom we were still in the game. Radha Yadav especially, gives 100 percent on the field and we need more characters like her. Even Richa Ghosh provided fire power at the end which gave us a chance to defend. We need to put on more runs on the board to win games which did not happen today but we learn from every mistake\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Amy Jones, England Captain:</strong></span> \"Feels nice, proud of the unit overall. The first game was quite daunting with less number of ,senior players around but a win in the first game settled our nerves pretty well. Someone Like Capsey is so good, plays freely and has got all shots in the book. Ecclestone too has been brilliant and helps around other bowlers too. She is world Class and we now look forward to the ODIs\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sophie Ecclestone, Player of the Match: </strong></span>I think the rules have changed a little and that has helped.

Both the teams come into the series with three wins on the trot. The hosts England defeated South Africa while Women in Blue did a similar feat against Sri Lankan Women. Although, England will ride on the momentum gained in the recently concluded T20 Series, India is a formidable side especially with Jhulan Goswami returning to the side for one last time. The 39 year old Pacer is the leading wicket taker in Women's Cricket with 252 scalps to her name. This is her final series and a pleasant farewell will be ideal for one of the Women's Cricket Legends, Jhulan Goswami.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India Women won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p>",

India's Spearhead Jhulan Goswami set the platform pretty well giving nothing away to the English batters early on. She completed her quota of ten overs conceding just 20 runs and also accounting for one top-order wicket. Thereafter, it was the Spinners that took charge of the ship. 5 out of the 7 wickets to fall went to the spinners. Deepti Sharma was the pick of the bowlers with 2 scalps for just 33 runs. England batters just managed to put up 227 runs on the board which was below par on this wicket. In response, Smriti Mandhana came out all guns blazing. A 96 run stand with Yastika Bhatia put India in the driver's seat. Mandhana was the top scorer amassing 91 at a strike rate of 92. Later on, an unbeaten 74 from the Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur took India home with almost six overs to spare.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Amy Jones, England Captain:</strong></span> \"Dissapointed that, we didn't do enough with the bat. But I think Alex batted brilliantly to give us a chance, but we needed some more wickets in the powerplay. We thought it was a tricky wicket, but I think India bowled well and then losing regular wickets cost us. Shefali's wicket early was very important, but we needed a couple more in the powerplay. I think Harman and Smriti batted very well.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Captain:</strong></span> \" We are very happy with the support we have got, very motivating. Very important win, we showed the character we were talking about in the T20Is. It was a crucial toss to win, and then there was a great bowling partnership between Meghna and Jhulan. I think everyone who came on gave us breakthroughs.&nbsp; I think there was a great partnership between Yashtika and Smriti, happy with the way I batted as well. Very important to get amongst the runs\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Player of the match is Smriti Mandhana.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#222222\">\"I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if I stayed not out, but big thanks to the Indian crowd for coming out to watch, glad we could put up a show for you guys. I think the One Day format is a natural game for me, because I like to go out there and time the ball, in T20Is I need to work on my strike rate. Really happy to score for India regardless of format and get that W on the board\".</span></p>",

Women in Blue looked in their element in the first ODI when they beat England comprehensively by 7 wickets. Smriti Mandhana was the top scorer for India in the chase scoring 91 runs while valuable contributions from Yastika Bhatia and Harmanpreet Kaur helped to seal the game with ease. The hosts will look to bounce back in this 'do or die encounter or else the team will have nothing to play for in the final ODI at Lords. On the other hand, Team India would look to continue the winning momentum and seal the series today itself. <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>It is Women in Blue's 300th ODI match overall and a Victory today will seal Team India's first series win in England since 1999.</strong></span></p><div>\u00a0</div><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">England Women won the toss and elected to field first!</span></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Amy Jones, England Captain:&nbsp;</strong></span>\"We think it'll get a bit nicer under lights, we've been focussing on their strengths.

Smriti Mandhana and Yastika Bhatia ensured that India got off to a solid start. Both stitched together a 54 run partnership to set the tone for the middle order. Thereafter the Indian Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur took over things in her hand. The hard hitting batter scored an unbeaten 143 of 111 balls also being involved in a match winning partnership with Harleen Deol. The duo compiled 113 runs of just 125 balls putting India in the driver's seat. It was always going to be an uphill task for the England women chasing 334 runs against the bowling attack of Women in Blue. The Indian bowlers never let any batter settle down, Renuka Singh was brilliant especially with the new ball and scalped 4 wickets in her ten overs. The spinners kept the scoring rate in check from the other end. England fell short by 88 runs eventually. India Women create history as it is their first series win after 1999 in England.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Amy Jones, England Captain:</strong></span> \"Every loss is tough and they got away from us at the end with the bat.

There are points to be had in the next game, so we need to improve\".&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur is the player of the match.</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Captain:</strong></span> \" When we came here, that was the goal (to win the series). Was a crucial win today as everybody stepped up. I always enjoy leadership as I'm always in the game and it feels good. When I was batting, during the first 50 runs, it wasn't all that easy. I just took my time and the partnership with Harleen was important. Just gave freedom to myself later as I was well set.\"</p>",

After being asked to bat first, the Indian women put up a challenging total of 169, thanks to the half-centuries from Smriti Mandhana and Deepti Sharma. Kate Cross was the pick of the English bowlers with her brilliant 4/26. Indian bowlers did an excellent job of defending the total. Renuka Thakur dismantled the English top order with her 4/29.

Thereafter, the returning Jemimah Rodrigues led the counterattack and made sure that the match does not slip out of hand. She stitched together a match winning partnership of 92(71) runs with Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur. She finished with 76 runs at a strike rate of 143 helping India reach a fighting total of 150 on a slow track at Sylhet. In response, the Sri Lankan openers started well but the introduction of spin straight away applied breaks in the Sri Lankan scoring rate. Also, courtesy of some brilliance in the field the Lankan batters were on the backfoot and behind the 9 ball.

On the other hand, Malaysia suffered a defeat against Pakistan and will look to bounce back in this encounter.

Both the openers came out all guns blazing and made sure that the opposition is on the backfoot from the very beginning. The Openers stitched together a partnership of 116 runs off just 83 balls in which Meghana played the role of an aggressor while Shafali played second fiddle. spoilsportMeghana top scored with 69 runs while Shafali finished at 46 of 39 deliveries. Richa Ghosh batting at number.3 took on the bowling straightaway smashing an unbeaten 33 at a strike rate of 174. A target of 182 was always going to be difficult for the Malaysian team against this Indian bowling attack. India started with spin from both ends and managed to restrict Malaysia at 16/2 in 5.2 overs. Rain played spoilsport and the match is adjudged in India's favour using the DL method.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the Live commentary of Match 8 of Women's Asia Cup, 2022 between India and UAE. The Women in blue have started with a bang winning both of their previous encounters, one against Sri Lanka and the other against Malaysia just a day ago. UAE on the other hand lost their previous game against Sri Lanka. The Indian team rested a few of their players in order to keep them fresh for the business end of the tournament and that looks like the template going forward in this hectic Asia Cup schedule. Indian Skipper, Harmanpreet Kaur believes in the ideology of the rotation policy which will give enough time in the middle to the bench strength that possesses a lot of talent. India is the tournament favorite but there should not be any room for complacency in a format where winning momentum matters the most.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This pitch is getting better for batting. There are some cracks that will hold up. It's getting drier and drier.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Women</span> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">won the toss and elected to bat first!</span></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana India Captain:</strong></span> \"We will bat first. It's a good wicket to bat and we want our batters sto go out there and put up a good score. Malaysia were amazing, we're excited to play UAE for the first time. It's going to be a good contest. Four changes for us\"&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Chaya Mughal, UAE Captain: </strong></span>\"We wanted to bowl first, our bowling is slightly weak and we want to do our best. There is pressure when we play elite teams, but we will play our normal game and enjoy ourselves. Will look to restrict them to as less as possible. One change for us\"</p>",

The team was in a bit of trouble after losing three early wickets within the powerplay but thereafter it was a brilliant match winning 128 run stand between Jemimah Rodrigues and Deepti Sharma that demoralised the UAE bowling attack. Deepti made 64 off 49 balls while Jemimah remained unbeaten with 75 of just 45 balls. A total of 178 for UAE was always going to be difficult to chase down. UAE lost 3 wickets with just 5 runs on board and could not find its way back into the game. India eventually wins the game convincingly by 104 runs and will now face Pakistan in their Asia Cup encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Chaya Mughal, UAE Captain:</strong></span> \" I mean the way we started bowling, it was really good. We need improvements in some of the areas. When you have a good start, you need to carry on with same momentum. We have got good openers but unfortunately they couldn't work much.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana, India Captain:</strong></span> \"I think they bowled really well in the Powerplay. Jemimah and Deepti batted really well to help us get back in the game. They batted well. We had one dropped catch. They didn't give their wicket away so well played to them as well.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jemimah Rodrigues , Player of the match:</strong></span> \" My mindset is simple. I just go out there and score as much as I can for the team. I just wanted to pick up the momentum. I had the same talk with Deepti. It took some time as it is not the easiest of wickets but it always helps with such a partner at the other end.\"</p>",

We do not have a lot of experienced players, but they are good players and think they will play a lot of cricket in the future.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Renuka Singh is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Renuka Singh:</strong></span> \"Very happy because the last few games I didn't bowl well. I practiced with my coach and the staff and they really helped me get back my rhythm. Just focussed on my basics and got success. My whole team supported me really well and credit should go to my captain, coach and staff.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma is the Player of the tournament:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma:</strong></span> \"Really happy with the way we performed as unit from the first game till today. We executed what was discussed in the meeting. I just back my strengths and those things helped me a lot in this tournament. The wickets were slow and before this tournament, I worked a lot on my batting and those sessions really helped me. This win gives us a lot of confidence going into the upcoming series as well.\"</p>",

The first two matches take place at Dr. DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai while the next three would be played at Brabourne CCI, Mumbai. The year 2022 has been amazing for the Indian women as they have entertained us throughout and have also brought us laurels by winning the Asia Cup title and for also bagging the Silver Medal in their maiden appearance in the Common Wealth Games. The Indian team would look to wrap up by winning their final series of this year while the Australian team would also like to impose their authority. This is going to be a scintillating series without any doubt and let us all wait for the final result.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>India and Australia have locked horns against each other 25 times and Australia has won 18 matches while India has won 6.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Australia won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p>",

Australia won the toss and elected to bowl first. The Indian openers Shafali Varma (21 off 10) and Smriti Mandhana (28 off 22) started aggressively and scored a total of 48 runs within the powerplay. The fiery knock from R Ghosh (36 off 20) and Deepti Sharma (36* off 15) steered the team to a total of 172 runs. In the second innings, A Healy scored 37 runs in 23 balls and the other opener B Mooney went on to play a match-winning knock of 89* runs off 57 along with T Mcgrath who scored (40* off 29).

Have to take those chances to win.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Alyssa Healy, Australian Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"It wasn't that easy when we were on the field. I thought they were below par. As per stats 185 is a par score here. We didn't finish great with the ball but we knew we were in the game.

India seals the match in their first-ever super over they have been part of! India won the toss and elected to bowl first. The Australian opener Beth Mooney(82* off 54) played stunningly along with Tahlia McGrath(70* off 51) as they partnered for 158* runs. The score at the end of 20 overs was 187 runs. In reply, the Indian batters Smriti Mandhana(79 off 49) and Shafali Verma(34 off 23) set up the chase by scoring 55 runs in the powerplay! Richa Ghosh who played an innings full of crackling shots took the team close to the target and with 5 runs to win in the final delivery, Devika Vaidya smacked a boundary which led to the first-ever super over to be faced by the Indian women.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In the super over, Richa Ghosh and Smriti Mandhana opened and Heather Graham took over the ball. The super over was ignited with a maximum on the first ball by Richa after which Smriti continued her touch in the remaining deliveries as she struck 13* runs in 3 balls. With a huge task of chasing 21 runs in the super over, Renuka Singh was given the ball. The skipper Alyssa Healey tried her best to take the team over the line but it was the Indian team who held their nerve and bagged the match!</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;With this Victory, India becomes the first team to beat Australia in T20Is, this year!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Alyssa Healy, Australia Captain:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span>\"Missed a bit with the ball tonight and they cashed in. What a great advertisement for women's cricket this has been, with forty thousand people here tonight. We did well to hang in there in the end and get it to the Super Over, India were all over us in that chase. We fought well to get us to that position.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I think everyone in the Indian team enjoys chasing. We also need to work on setting totals though. When they were batting, I realised it was an amazing wicket, I had my eyes on a big score. Didn't want to make the same mistake as the last innings. Happy to see such wickets prepared for women's cricket, you'll get high scores, high run chases.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur,&nbsp; India Captain:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We kept backing ourselves. We learnt a lot from the previous game. If someone could get a bit more, then we could have got even 200. So that was the plan today, to back ourselves. I was always backing Richa, even when she wasn't getting runs. Today we saw what we could do with her power hitting. Fielding is something we need to keep working at, we gave too many runs today. Bowling was better today, because this wicket was too easy to bat on, nothing for the bowlers.\"</p>",

In the five-match WT20I series, the first match ended in the favour of Australia after which the Indian women made a comeback in the second match by winning the thriller in the super over. Australia again won the third match and they lead the T20I series 2-1! It is a must-win game for India to take the series alive to the final one on Tuesday. Will India bag the match and take the result to the ultimate match or will Australia turn victorious and seal the series today?&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India Captain: </strong></span>\"It's always good to chase in the night games. As there's grass on the wicket and our seamers are doing well, we want to keep doing the same. I think in our side, everybody has the ability to hit sixes and we want to back ourselves. <strong>One change - Harleen Deol replaces Rajeshwari Gayakwad</strong>\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Alyssa Healy, Australia Captain:</strong></span> \"We would have probably had a bowl but batting first worked last time so we are happy. I think we absorbed the pressure they put on us and we took wickets regularly so we want to do more of that. Holding our catches in this really long boundary is important for us. <strong>Heather Graham returns in place of Nicola Carey</strong>\"</p>",

After winning the toss and choosing to bowl first, the women in blue picked up 2 wickets in quick succession, containing Australia to 70/2 in the first 10 overs. That's when Ellyse Perry and Ashleigh Gardner decided to take charge and accelerate the innings. They had a partnership of 94 in 59 balls. Grace Harris helped Australia end the innings on a high note and helped them post a mammoth total of 188. Having a massive task ahead, the women in blue started off well but ended up losing 3 wickets before the end of 7 overs. That's when Harmanpreet Kaur stepped in and played a captain's knock of 46 in 30, putting up a partnership of 72 runs with Devika Vaidya. Richa Ghosh came up with a few big blows in the death overs but unfortunately, India fell a little short. Alana King and Ashleigh Gardner were the picks of the Australian bowlers with 2 wickets each! Australia now wins the 5-match series, after winning 3 out of 4 games.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India captain, Harmanpreet Kaur: </strong></span>\"I think we were in the game throughout but just one over here or there can make the difference. Yes definitely, if I were there till the end things would have been different. But still, after I got out I had faith in Deepti and Richa. I think the 18th over where we scored just three runs was what made the difference. I think all the young girls who got to play against this Aussie side got a lot of experience. I am really proud of how we bowled in the first 10 overs. We won a lot of areas today and I am really proud of that. [On not bowling] I picked up an injury during Asia Cup, so just batting right now.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Australia stand-in captain, Tahlia Mcgrath:</strong></span> \"Very last-minute, thrown into captaining. But couldn't be prouder of this team. Yeah, new to the role and thrown into the deep end, but have had some help. The bowlers all stuck to their plans. New wicket, played reasonably similarly and produced some turn, but really good wicket. Calf strain, Alyssa's with the medical team, we'll see how she goes.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ashleigh Gardner is the player of the match.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ashleigh Gardner:</strong></span> \"I think every single pitch we have played on while here in India has been fantastic to play on. I just think it was really crucial what lengths you bowl. I know if you pitch it up, it's easier to hit straight down the ground. So I was just bowling it into the ground. It's important to be able to mix up your lengths. I know T20 cricket is quite batter friendly and everyone just assumes that when you come to India there will be lot of spin, but in this format, you don't expect much turn.\"</p>",

India is taking on the hosts South Africa in this first encounter at the Buffalo park stadium, East London. A total of 7 matches will be played in this series, including the finals. In 2020, right before the T20 world cup, India played a tri-series in Australia. This time, similarly, continuing the practice for the T20 World Cup in South Africa starting next month. Smriti Mandhana will be leading the Indian team today due to the absence of Harmanpreet Kaur who is out due to sickness and the hosts will be led by Sune Luus. These two sides met last time in 2022 where the Proteas sealed the series 2-1 against the Women in Blue in India.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>HEAD TO HEAD :-</strong></span></p><p>India women and South Africa women have faced each 12 times in this format and India clearly have the upper hand winning 8 out of those 12 encounters.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>TOSS:-</strong></span></p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\">South Africa won the toss and elected to field first!</span></strong></p>",

With the ball, Deepti Sharma picked two early wickets within the powerplay and built pressure. S Campbelle(47 off 57) and S Gajnabi(34* off 29) changed their gears after drinks in the tenth over but the target was too high to chase in the end and India seals the match!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Hayley Matthews, West Indies Skipper</strong></span>: \"We did not have a positive intent and failed to rotate strike. Campbelle and I had a chat and decided to get going. The Indian batters played really well and the drop chances proved costly. We have to improve our game and step up for the next crucial game.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"We didn't want to hurry with the bat at any cost, and keeping wickets gives you confidence. We have to bat really well on these pitches where runs are not easy to get. Smriti batted well and so it was easy for me to hit. I was not available for the previous match and I am happy to make runs today.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana:</strong></span>&nbsp;\"I think the wicket was similar. But after the first game we understood our mistakes and learned how to bat on that wicket. That's what we discussed and we did not want to go hard in the first few overs and that's what the team expected from me. When Harmanpreet came out it became easy to make that score\"</p>",

The teams played here to get through the final on Thursday for which India and South Africa got qualified already. West Indies appeared and experienced only losses in their three matches and today they will play their last match in this series. This fixture could be helpful for the Indian team to try new players and enter the final fixture with positive momentum if they win here. Will the benched players get a chance today?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>India won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p>",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p>India maintains their unbeaten streak in the series and enters the final as the topper of the table! This victory would give a lot of confidence to the team as they have performed pleasingly in all the departments of the game. As India batted first in all their fixtures this series, the skipper Harmanpreet opted to bowl first. Deepti Sharma was the star with the ball as she picked three wickets in total in which the first two were successive ones. The approach was controlled by the batters and the run flow was minimal. The WI skipper H Matthews fought well and made 34 runs. With a low target of 95 runs to chase, the opener J Rodrigues struck 42* runs along with the Skipper Harmanpreet(32* off 23). The finals will be played between India and South Africa on Thursday!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Hayley Matthews, West Indies Captain: </strong></span>\"The way Shamilia Connell is bowling is a big positive for us. It is nice to see a few Under-19 players make their debut. There has been good energy in the team and really happy to have them. Having some options is always nice. Cricket is a sport where anything can happen on the day. We just have to believe that we will turn things in our favor.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Captain:</strong></span> \"I think we bowled well but still I feel we could have done better than this. Amount of bowling we have we were looking to restrict them to under 80 but anyway we will take it in a positive way. I think it's a great positive when you have too many options and you have to keep thinking about what is your best eleven and the next game will be a great opportunity for us to try the final eleven. The way Jemimah played was very impressive and I am happy that I could score too.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma is the Player of the Match&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma: </strong></span>\"The captain, and everyone have faith on me. I practiced a lot to bowl in the powerplay and coming at the end of the innings. They are supporting me and that's what gives me confidence. I really don't feel pressure. I just enjoy it whenever I get to bowl.\"&nbsp;</p>",

India were forced to bowl first by West Indies and the bowlers did a pretty good job! After a loss of a wicket in the second over, the West Indies batters Stafanie Taylor(42 off 40) and Shemaine Campbelle(30 off 36) steadied the ship by partnering for 73 runs. Deepti Sharma was given the ball in the 14th over and provided the breakthrough with these two crucial wickets in that over. The score at the end of the innings was 118 runs. With less target to defend, the West Indian bowlers bowled well and picked two wickets in the powerplay but the usual explosive innings from Shafali Verma(28 off 23) took the team to a decent run rate. After the wicket of Shafali, the Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur(33 off 42) and Richa Ghosh(44* off 32) provided a stand and steered the team to victory by 6 wickets.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma:</strong></span> \"I am feeling good.

The Women in Blue head into this encounter on the back of two consecutive victories and a win here tonight will ensure a place in the Semi-Finals for the Indian side. England too step into this vital contest with two wins and would want to take the winning momentum into the knock-out stage of the tournament. It will be a cracker of a contest between two sides that are unbeaten in the tournament so far.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p><p>India and England have played each other 26 times and 7 of the matches have been won by the Women in Blue.

After winning the toss and opting to field, India got off to the perfect start with the ball, picking up three wickets inside the Powerplay courtesy of some brilliant new ball bowling from Renuka, who later went on to register her maiden 5-wicket haul in International cricket, and a fighting half-century from Nat Sciver-Brunt ensured that England put on 151 on the board. In the chase, Smriti Mandhana got India off to a flyer in the Powerplay and registered her 7th half-century against England in WT20I, but a clinical performance from the English spinners helped them defend their target. India are back in action in just two days at the same venue against Ireland for their last group game. Follow us then!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India skipper: </strong></span>\"We started really well but in the middle overs we didn't bowl according to plan and gave away too many runs and lost the momentum. We were doing well with the bat but didn't get the run rate that we were looking for and that's why we lost wickets. Whenever Renuka's bowling we are looking for wickets and she's someone who enjoys her spell, good to see her doing so well. We did well in patches but there are some areas we need to work on.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Heather Knight, England skipper:</strong></span> \"We talk a lot about trying to fit our mindset to the conditions and that partnership between myself and Nat was the key. Nat steadied the innings really well and then Amy was outstanding. It shows our batting depth, and even after losing three wickets, we can put up a good score. Renuka was outstanding and was nipping the ball both ways, but keeping a positive mindset helps to manipulate the field. We haven't played against a big team recently and to go out and play like that was really good. Our ground fielding was outstanding and the best so far. We dropped a couple of catches but that can happen in these big games.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Nat Sciver-Brunt is the Player of the Match</strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nat Sciver-Brunt:</strong></span> \"It was tough, the Indian bowlers were getting it to seam a lot, Renuka got five wickets and bowled brilliantly. We had to soak it up a little bit but make sure we put our foot forward and take the attack on as well. We didn't get the start we wanted but we were good in the middle overs and ensured we kept going for the boundaries. It was great to have atmosphere like that.\"</p>",

Smriti Mandhana has been the top performer with the bat for India with 149 runs at a staggering average of 49.67 whereas Allysa Healy has been in good form scoring 146 runs at an average of 73. Looking at the bowling side of things, Renuka Thakur has been lethal with the new ball and has provided the start that Team India will look forward to in this vital semi-final encounter against a formidable Australian line-up. Although Australia is a favorite heading into the match, India possesses all the goods to create an upset at a stage where it matters the most.

In response, India did not get the desired start but Jemimah Rodrigues and Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur stitched together a 69-run partnership of 41 balls to get India back on track. Kaur made 52 of 34 balls before getting run out in the most unlucky manner after which the tide turned in Australia's favor. India was cruising on at a point in time but the spell from Darcie Brown that got the wicket of Jemimah Rodrigues proved to be crucial in the end. The fast bowler bowled four overs conceding just 18 runs and accounted for three dismissals. Heartbreak for India but one has to give it to the fighting spirit of the Women in blue who put up an inspiring performance losing by a very narrow margin of five runs.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ashleigh Gardener is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ashleigh Gardener: \"Just shows the way we play and fight as a team, and that's what we kind of spoke about in the team huddle right at the end. We probably weren't in a winning position and that's when this team does best. When our backs are up against the wall, we find a way and we scrap really hard and that's what we did today with the ball.\"</strong></span></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Meg Lanning, Australia Captian: </span></strong>\"One of the best wins I have been involved in. To fight back from well behind and win despite not playing our best cricket. Great fighting spirit from the girls, couldn't be more proud of them.&nbsp; India came hard at us and they have got some incredible players. Came right down to the wire and we had to seize those clutch moments which is exactly what we did. Found a way out when the situation was not in our favour\".&nbsp;</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India Skipper: </strong></span>\"Can't be unluckier than this, to get that momentum back when I and Jemimah were batting. And to lose after that partnership was totally unexpected. The way I got runout, can't be unluckier than that. Putting in the effort was more important. We discussed fighting till the last ball butThe result didn't go our way. I am happy with the way we played in this tournament. \"&nbsp;</p>",

The tour consists of three T20s and three ODIs between the two Asian giants. The Women in Blue have had the better of the hosts in terms of the head-to-head record against Bangladesh, having won 11 out of 13 T20Is played between the teams. It will be interesting to see how the Harmanpreet Kaur led side adjusts to the conditions in Dhaka against a formidable unit in their own backyard. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>HEAD TO HEAD:-</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Women</span></strong> and <strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\">Bangladesh Women</span></strong> have clashed 13 times in which India has 11 games to their credit while the hosts Bangladesh has just managed to win 2 matches.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Women </span>won the toss and elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India Women Captain: &quot;We will field first.

We will look to bowl wicket-to-wicket, looking for breakthroughs early on. &nbsp;We want to play free cricket and enjoy ourselves. We have two debutants in our side. Important is that We need to come out here and execute our plans&quot;.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Sultana, Bangladesh Women Captain: &quot;I think it is a decent track to bat on.

India restricted the run flow in the powerplay after winning the toss and asking Bangladesh to bat first. The spinners did an excellent job in the middle overs giving nothing away to the batting side. Bangladesh managed only 42 runs in the over slab 9-15 and also lost two crucial wickets. To defend a score of 115 was never going to be easy going against a strong Indian batting unit. Although Shafali Verma got out in the first over, Smriti Mandhana made sure that runs kept flowing from the other end. A 70 run stand between Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur took the game away from the hosts with very little scope of a comeback. Mandhana scored 38 while Kaur remained unbeaten on 54 taking the team home in the 17 over of the game.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Sultana, Bangladesh Women Captain: &quot;The bowlers did a decent job. &nbsp;There were a lot of dot balls while we batted. Need to work on that. Looking forward to the next match.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Player of the Match: Smriti Mandhana</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India Women Captain: &quot;We were able to execute our plans. Overall it was a great performance by our team. I think Deepti Sharma did well showing her experience. Smriti Mandhana showed her character today, with that batting line-up you don&#39;t need to worry much.

India Losing three wickets in a matter of 6 balls tilted the momentum in Bangladesh&#39;s favor. Bangladesh Spinners gave nothing away in the middle overs picking three wickets for just 28 runs. It was never going to be easy defending 96 but the Indian bowlers started well in the powerplay conceding at less than 4 r.p.o and accounting for two dismissals. But Captain Nigar Sultana kept scoring from one end which kept the home team in contention. It was Deepti Sharma who got the big wicket of Sultana while Shafali Verma did the damage at the back end.

My plan was just to bowl according to the situation, and bowl more dot balls. We told everyone to keep calm and think about the process. Whatever we do, we have to do it with confidence. Everyone did well as a team and whenever I get the opportunity with the bat, I want to do well.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The first of the three ODI series will take place at the Shere Bangla National Stadium, Dhaka which is also the venue for the other two matches to follow. After a good outing in the T20 format, Women in Blue would be looking to continue the winning momentum and maintain their unbeaten record against the hosts in the 50-Over format whereas the hometeam would be looking to build on the positives from the T20 series and play with intent this time around.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\nThe Women in Blue have an unbeaten 5 to Nil record against Bangladesh.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nSyed Abid Hossain Sami: &quot;This is the ODI series opener and we are having overcast conditions due to rain last night. There is little Grass cover but it&#39;s a tough surface.

India started well after winning the toss and asking Bangladesh to bat first. The bowlers did an excellent job keeping the score to just 14 in the first ten overs and also accounting for 2 Top order wickets. Bangladeshi Skipper Nigar Sultana carried on from one end but lacked support from the other. She compiled 39 runs helping her team reach 152. Amanjot Kaur picking up 4 wickets in her debut game was the pick of the bowlers. Team India in response did not have the best of starts losing 3 wickets in the first 10 overs. Bangladeshi Spinners continued to apply pressure in the middle overs giving nothing away. Rabeya Khan bowled tight overs conceding at just 3.80 r.p.o and scalping three wickets. However, the major damage was done by Marufa Akter who got rid of both the openers as well as got two wickets of consecutive balls in the 29th over of the game. Deepti Sharma top scored with 20 but succumbed under pressure eventually.

In bowling also, we were not up to the mark. We don&#39;t have any issue with leg spin but sometimes some bowlers bowl very well. Overall we are not batting up to the mark and not bowling according to our strengths. We have done well in ODI cricket and we have to back ourselves to come back from this point.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Nigar Sultana, Bangladesh Women Captain: &quot;In the first innings I think we were 30-40 runs short of what we wanted on board on this track. The lower-order batters gave us some vital runs. All credit to the bowlers, they assessed the wicket well and executed their plans to their best. Thank you to the crowd, they boosted the morale of the team. The thing was that we wanted to get early wickets.

In the last two matches, we didn&#39;t play to our strength. In our playing eleven, we have 2 changes. It is a fresh wicket and we hope it will play better than the previous one.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Nigar Sultana, Bangladesh Women Captain: &quot;It is a fresh wicket and our bowling can actually work here. We feel that we can chase down here. The team has always been like this but there is now some confidence after the last two matches. I am glad that we are playing well as a team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

India got off to a decent start after being sent in by Bangladesh courtesy of Smriti Mandhana who got back to form scoring a well-composed 36. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues stitched together a brilliant partnership of 98 from 106 balls to put India in the driver&#39;s seat. Rodrigues top scored with 86 at a staggering strike rate of 110. A total of 228 was never going to be easy to chase on a slow and sluggish track at Dhaka. Indian bowlers gave nothing away in the powerplay bowling 4 maiden overs on the trot. Thereafter it was the Indian spinners that ran through the Bangladeshi middle order.&nbsp; The Spin pair of Rodrigues and Devika Vaidya scalped 7 wickets between them conceding just 33 runs in 11 overs. The hosts lost their last 7 wickets for just 14 runs, falling short by 108 eventually.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India Women&#39;s Captain: &quot;We wanted to bat and got that. It was a great opportunity for us to bat first and set up a good total on the board. We spoke about one of the batters batting till the end, when Jemimah came in we played according to the situation and the focus was on taking singles. We have been batting on flat tracks, played ODIs after a long time and hence were not able to adjust quickly, but we spoke about how to adjust and bat on these surfaces. It will be a good final in two days&#39; time.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Nahida Akter, Bangladesh Women&#39;s Stand-in Captain: &quot;The fielding was not up to the mark today and the bowling too did not click, we could not restrict them and India posted a good total. Bangladesh will look to overcome the hurdles and play better in the final ODI.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jemimah Rodrigues is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jemimah Rodrigues: &quot;I&#39;d be lying to say that I wasn&#39;t under pressure, we saw how good the hosts were in the first match. But as a team, we spoke about how we can we bounce back after a loss. Harman and I were bating really well then Harleen came into the middle and gave us that extra push. I didn&#39;t try to do anything extra, just tried to pitch the ball in the right spots and allow the pitch to do the rest, credit to the team management for believing in my bowling.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The hosts created history by going past Women in Blue in the first ODI of the series after which Team India bounced back by winning the second ODI comprehensively by 108 runs.

It is now time for the series decider!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:<br />\nTeam India has come out victorious on 6 occasions while Bangladesh has clinched 1 game from the 7 ODI clashes between the teams.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nSame pitch that was used in the first ODI where Bangladesh women went on to win the match. Can be another low-scoring encounter like we have seen in the series. The team batting first should see through the first ten overs and then look to play their shots. The team winning the toss should look to put some runs on the board.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\nBangladesh has won the toss and has elected to Bat first&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Nigar Sultana, Bangladesh Women Captain: &quot;We want to bat first.

As they say, in the end, it is Cricket that wins the contest. Bangladesh got off to a good start keeping all their wickets intact until the 26th over of the innings. A partnership of 93 between the two openers Shamima Sultana and Fargana Hoque set the platform for the hosts. Hoque was involved in another 71-run stand with the Skipper Nigar Sultana. Fargana Hoque created history by becoming the first Bangladeshi Batter to score a century in ODIs. In response to 225, Women in Blue lost Shafali Verma and Yastika Bhatia early in the innings but a 107-run stand between Smriti Mandhana and Harleen Deol had India in the driver&#39;s seat for the most part of the second innings. Smriti Mandhana scored 59 before falling to the leg spinner Fahima Khatun. Deol was going great guns from one end but an untimely dismissal in the form of a run out changed the course of the game. The 42nd over accounted for two run-outs and proved to be the turning point of the match. India was cruising along but lost 6 wickets in the last 10 overs failing to get over the line. Nevertheless it was a valiant effort to tie the game in this nail-biting encounter.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Fargana Hoque is the Player of the Series</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harleen Deol is Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harleen Deol: &quot; It was a good wicket to bat.

But it is always good to have some runs under your belt.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Nigar Sultana, Bangladesh Women Captain: &quot;It was a great match, we are getting a lot of experience which will help us. We thought we need 230-plus runs on this pitch. Fargana Hoque batted really well. We tried to enjoy the game and the fight from the team was unbelievable. After the break, we were discussing either they will come hard on us or we will go hard on them. The bowlers did a fantastic job. This is a good step for us for the future, to build a good side and hopefully, we can take things from here.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Women&#39;s Captain: I think a lot of learning for us from this game. Even apart from the play, the kind of decisions from the umpires were surprising. The next time we travel to Bangladesh we will make sure we had to deal with this kind of umpiring and prepare ourselves accordingly. Bangladeshi batters batted really well and adapted&nbsp; according to the situation. They were rotating the strike which was very crucial. In between we did leak a few runs but we had controlled the game very well when we were batting as I quoted earlier some bad umpiring was done we are really unhappy about some of the decisions that were given by the umpires.</strong></span></p>\n",

Skipper Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma came out all guns blazing smashing a little over 50 in the first five overs. Malaysia later managed to get the big wicket of Mandhana but had no answers to the Shafali Verma on-slaught which dismantled their bowling attack. Verma smashed 67 at a staggering strike rate of 171 before getting out in the 13th over. Verma and Rodrigues added 86 from just 47 balls for the 2nd wicket. Richa Ghosh coming in at number 4 displayed her power-hitting prowess scoring 21 from just 7 deliveries taking the Indian tally to a mammoth 173.

This match is particularly significant as it marks the beginning of a long home season for the Women in Blue.</p>\n\n<p>The team, riding high on confidence after their triumph at the Asian Games, is eager to maintain their winning momentum. They are under the guidance of their new head coach, Amol Muzumdar. This match is not just about winning the day but also about setting a strong foundation for the upcoming T20 World Cup next year. The Indian team, having tasted victory at a major event like the Asian Games, is now more determined than ever to continue their success story. The anticipation for tonight&#39;s game is palpable, with the hopes of a nation resting on the Women in Blue, who are all set to kickstart their journey towards the T20 World Cup with a victory.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 27 games,<strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India - 7.</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">England - 20.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>HERMANPREET KAUR CALLS RIGHT AT THE TOSS AND ENGLAND WILL BOWL FIRST!!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Skipper: &quot;We&#39;ve decided to field first. Our strategy is to apply pressure on their batters since it&#39;s the opening match, and often it&#39;s challenging to determine what constitutes a solid score. Additionally, our team excels in chasing scores. Today marks the debut of Shreyanka and Saika. Our goal is to maintain our strong performance here in Mumbai.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Heather Knight, English Skipper: &quot;</strong><strong>We would have also chosen to bowl first had we won the toss. We&#39;ve had a few days to get used to the conditions here. We aim to continue developing based on our performance over the last year. We had a successful run during the English summer season, demonstrating significant determination.

The match began with India winning the toss and opting to field. India got off to an excellent start, with Renuka Singh picking up two wickets in the very first over. However, from that point onwards, England&#39;s performance remained dominant.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Danni Wyatt and Nat Sciver-Brunt played a pivotal role, forging a formidable partnership of 138 runs. Nat Sciver-Brunt contributed significantly with 77 runs, while Danni Wyatt&#39;s 75 runs, combined with Amy Jones&#39; exceptional performance in the death overs, enabled England to post a substantial total of 197 runs. Renuka Singh was the standout performer among the Indian bowlers, claiming 3 wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, the Indian women&#39;s team initiated their innings positively. However, the English spinners played a crucial role in shifting the momentum in their favor. Sophie Ecclestone&#39;s exceptional bowling figures of 3/15 in 4 overs stood out as a highlight of England&#39;s bowling performance. Shafali Verma made a notable contribution with a half-century, but it ultimately proved insufficient as England secured a convincing victory. This win provides England with an early lead in the series, setting the stage for an exciting contest in the upcoming matches.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur (India Captain) - &quot;We must absorb these lessons swiftly, as these types of matches are invaluable for our growth before the T20 World Cup. Acknowledging the strength of our opponents in their batting lineup, it&#39;s important to note that we&#39;ve made some adjustments in our bowling department. We are determined to bounce back with greater resilience. While our performance in the match fell short of our expectations, we are committed to analyzing the positives and approaching the next game with a positive mindset. Despite having control of the game after losing a couple of wickets, the final 10 overs didn&#39;t unfold as we had strategized.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Heather Knight (England Captain) - &quot;The game unfolded positively, aligning with our desired approach. While I would have preferred to bowl first, I&#39;m genuinely satisfied with our batting performance and the total we achieved. It&#39;s worth noting that we allowed some extras, an area where improvement is possible, but overall, it was a good game against a strong Indian side.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nat Sciver-Brunt (Player of the Match) - &quot;It&#39;s a wonderful feeling to reunite with the England team and deliver a performance of this caliber. We aimed to exhibit courage in our approach, and Danni executed that brilliantly, relieving some of the pressure on me. I&#39;m genuinely delighted with how our partnership unfolded. We each bring our unique strengths to the table, and our partnership functions seamlessly. The pitch was in good condition, offering some assistance to the spinners with a slight hold, and the slower deliveries proved effective, adding a layer of challenge for the opposing batters.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n",

The result in the first T20 was not a favourable one for India but Harmanpreet Kaur &amp; Co. would look to pick up from the positives of the first game and bounce back in the second encounter. England after securing a 32-run win in the first match would look to capitalize on the momentum and seal the series. It will be interesting to see India&#39;s tactics in this all-important do-or-die encounter.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report:<br />\nCharles Dagnall and Anjum Chopra: &quot;50m and 53m square boundaries, 60m straight down the ground. It looks like a belter of a track. Beautiful batting paradise here at Wankhede. The challenge for the bowlers will be about figuring out where to pitch the ball.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">England women win the toss and elect to field first!</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Heather Night, England Women Skipper: &quot; We&rsquo;re going to have a bowl, generally as a side, we prefer chasing targets. Brilliant start from the batting group in the first T20, really pleased with the way we went about our business. A couple of things we could&rsquo;ve sharpened up with the ball which we will look to work upon. Charlie Dean comes in for Mahika Gaur.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India Women Skipper: &quot; We were looking to field as well but everyone was ok with whatever. The only thing about bowling second was the dew factor but it wasn&rsquo;t there in the last game so we are okay with batting first. We had a very positive meeting the other day, we understood our field placements and the areas we need to bowl better. Kanika Ahuja goes out and Titas Sadhu comes in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

England&#39;s decision to bowl first paid off as India lost 4 wickets in the powerplay and thereafter failed to make a comeback. Charlotte Dean was the pick of the bowlers getting the wickets of both the openers early in the innings. England too had their struggles with the bat as Renuka Singh made the new ball talk making it difficult when the ball was new. But a partnership between Alice Capsey and Sciver Brunt which added 42 runs made sure that India had hardly any chance to stage a dramatic comeback. Deepti Sharma who was introduced in the ninth over managed to scalp two in two deliveries but that was not enough to restrict the English side under 80. Not clinical but England manage to clinch the game and series on the back of this win.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur, India Women Skipper: &quot; Another 30-40 runs could have made a big difference. Proud of my team, we fought till the last run which is a good thing to see. We always want to play with positive intent, but unfortunately, some of us didn&#39;t read the ball well and the English Team also bowled well which didn&#39;t allow us to score freely. After losing early wickets, we were thinking 120, but couldn&#39;t manage. Still proud of our bowlers.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Heather Night, England Women Skipper: &quot; A brilliant game of Cricket and the crowd was outstanding too, you felt the pressure out in the middle. Charlie Dean bowled a lot for us in the powerplay, she provides that balance in the side and I thought our bowling unit bowled well. I thought it was quite hard for our openers and I thought Renuka Singh bowled well and the job was to score as many in the powerplay and not lose too many wickets. We have a Test match coming up and we want to win the series 3-0.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Charlotte Dean &nbsp;is the Player of the Match</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Charlotte Dean: &quot;Really happy with how the game played out for us, the bowlers around me made it very easy for me. In T20 I find it important not to get stuck bowling the same ball again and again and need to vary the pace and see how the batters react. I have a gut feeling on where people are trying to hit me and I plan accordingly. I usually try to target the stumps more often.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

The experiences I gained in the Women&#39;s Premier League and with the India-A team have been beneficial. I am very happy to be a part of the Indian squad and am enjoying every moment of it. It&#39;s been a huge experience for me, bowling in tandem with Deepthi. She has been a great support, having discussions with me both on and off the field. I am looking forward to bowling more with her. I enjoyed all three of my wickets and it&#39;s hard to pick just one as a favorite&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Heather Knight, England Captain: &quot;This match provided valuable learning opportunities. We decided to rest some key players and give others a chance to showcase their skills. The crowd was fantastic, and I hope the experience taught our younger players how to maintain composure under pressure. Shreyanka bowled exceptionally well against us. We didn&#39;t quite apply ourselves as effectively as we could have. Our batting wasn&#39;t up to our usual standard; reaching a score around 140 might have made the game more competitive. Nonetheless, there are many positives to take from this. We managed to put pressure back on the Indian team and learned a lot about our younger players.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nat Sciver-Brunt, Player of the Series: &quot;I&#39;m really pleased with my performance. I had a bit of a rest tonight but it was still a special and enjoyable game of cricket, especially for the fans. The wicket was slightly slower and less consistent compared to the first game. The Indian bowlers performed superbly, making it challenging for us. In terms of my batting, focusing on the tempo and committing to my shots are aspects I&#39;ve been working on, and they seem to be paying off. Adaptability is crucial in cricket, as every game presents a different situation.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Welcome to the live cricketing action as India Women host England Women for the only Test at Dr DY Patil Sports Academy in Navi Mumbai. Harmanpreet Kaur led India, enter the contest after a win in the third T20I by five wickets, they did lose the first two games but the win in the last game would have boosted their confidence heading into the Test. England, on the other hand, after winning the T20I series will look to carry the form going into the Tests. It will be interesting to see how the two teams will fare.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India Women vs England Women Head-to-Head in Tests:</strong><br />\nIn as many as 14 games played between the two, India have won two games while England have won just one game. 11 of the games have ended in Draw.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India have won the toss and will bat first.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Murali Karthik: </strong>&quot;The venue is exceptional, featuring a high-quality surface. There&#39;s a uniform spread of grass, notably green in color. The pitch currently feels a bit damp and cool to the touch. Bowlers are likely to find favorable conditions in the initial hour or so, after which the pitch should become more conducive for batting. As for spin, it largely depends on the bowler&#39;s mindset. We can expect the pitch to start showing signs of wear towards the end of the third day, potentially influencing the game&#39;s progression.&quot;</p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Day 1:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India- 410/7 (94 Overs, 4.4 rpo, 62x4, 2x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 2:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India- 18/3 (10.3 Overs, 1.7 rpo, 2x4, 0x6) </span>|| <span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">England- 136/10 (35.3 Overs, 3.8 rpo, 19x4, 0x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 3:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">England- 131/10 (27.3 Overs, 4.8 rpo, 21x4, 0x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The one-off Test between India and England concluded with a commanding victory for India, triumphing by an impressive margin of 347 runs. Opting to bat first on a favorable batting track, the Indian team displayed a collective batting effort. The team&#39;s innings was punctuated by a couple of substantial century stands, propelling them to a formidable total over 400. England&#39;s response with the bat was underwhelming. They struggled to find their footing against a disciplined and aggressive Indian bowling attack. The standout performer with the ball was Deepti Sharma, whose exceptional bowling spell yielded a five-wicket haul. Her efforts were instrumental in giving India a significant lead of 292 runs. Despite having the option to enforce the follow-on, captain Harmanpreet Kaur chose to bat again. On Day 2, India Women consolidated their position by adding vital runs, setting England a daunting target of 479 runs. England&#39;s second innings mirrored the first, with the batters failing to mount a significant challenge against India&#39;s bowling. Pooja Vastrakar and Deepti Sharma were particularly lethal with the ball in the second innings, taking three and four wickets respectively. England&#39;s batting lineup seemed bereft of answers to the questions posed by the Indian bowlers, particularly Sharma. Deepti Sharma&#39;s match performance was nothing short of extraordinary, contributing a crucial 87 runs with the bat and claiming a total of 9 wickets across both innings. Her all-round brilliance was a pivotal factor in India&#39;s dominant win, underlining her as a key player in the team&#39;s comprehensive victory.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>Heather Knight, England Skipper: &quot;India&#39;s performance was truly remarkable, and they really made us suffer. Their first-innings batting was impressive, and we took away many learnings from it. They deserve praise for their play. We faced quite challenging conditions, which were new to us, making scoring runs a difficult task. India stepped up their bowling game even more today compared to the first innings. There are numerous areas for us to work on. There were some exceptional individual performances on our side, notably Bell&rsquo;s consistent play. Although the match didn&#39;t unfold as we hoped, it provided us with valuable lessons and experiences.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma is the player of the match</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma: &quot;I&#39;m really feeling good, as I&#39;ve been eagerly anticipating this day. It&#39;s a matter of great pride for us, having successfully carried out our strategies. I&#39;m delighted with the outcomes we achieved. My approach was to maintain composure. We concentrated on building partnerships, and I&#39;m glad we were able to do that effectively. The pitch was quite supportive, so I focused on bowling in the correct zones. Harmanpreet advised me on targeting the right areas, which was very helpful.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Captain: &quot;I&#39;m feeling great. At the beginning of the match, our focus was on strategizing for the win. Fortunately, everything unfolded as we had planned. We had a few days of preparation before this game began, and all the players stepped up, taking responsibility and performing at their best. Our team was well-aware of their plans and implemented them successfully.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Women in blue, enter the contest on the back of a solid 347 runs win over England in the recently concluded Test and will be looking to replicate the same kind of performance against the Aussies. Deepti Sharma was the stand-out performer in that game, picking up five wickets and four wickets respectively and scoring a fifty in the first innings while both Satheesh Shuba and Jemimah Rodrigues had a memorable debut as both of them scored fifties in the first innings. Australia, on the other hand, played their last Test game way back in June 2023. They did defeated England by margin of 89 runs in Nottingham and will be looking to play the same kind of game against the home dominant India.

As the winning runs were struck, it was a moment of triumph and grace, fittingly sealed by Mandhana&#39;s stylish play. Sneh Rana, with a total of 7 wickets across the match, was rightfully adjudged the player of the match, her spellbinding performance a crucial pillar in India&#39;s impressive victory.

The prospect of participating in additional Test matches presents an interesting proposition that could have offered further insights into our capabilities and strategies. Despite a challenging start on the first day, the team exhibited commendable resilience and determination throughout the series. This was our first foray into red-ball cricket in these specific conditions, necessitating a rapid and robust adaptation process, in which our players have demonstrated considerable growth and performance. We extend our full commendation to the Indian team for their superior performance, effectively setting a daunting target. Reflecting on our approach, a more robust batting performance on the initial day might have significantly altered the game&#39;s trajectory. Securing the toss yet not fully capitalizing on the batting opportunity, combined with our subsequent concession of runs, was pivotal in shaping the series&#39; outcome. Ideally, a score around 300 would have presented a more formidable challenge, emphasizing the critical need for consistent and strategic execution throughout the entirety of the Test. The essence of Test cricket lies in its demand for sustained excellence and adaptability over each day of play. It is crucial for us to assimilate the learnings from our time at the Wankhede Stadium, leveraging the conditions and experiences to bolster our confidence and strategy. The opportunity to engage in both a practice game and this Test match has been invaluable in adjusting to the local conditions. As we look to the future, it is these accumulated experiences and adaptations that will enhance our preparedness and strategic acumen in upcoming matches.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Sneh Rana is the player of the match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Sneh Rana: &quot;It&#39;s truly an honor to stand here as the recipient of this award, and to celebrate such a significant Test victory. My role extended beyond that of a nightwatchman; batting alongside Smriti Mandhana was a seamless experience, reinforcing my batting capabilities. My focus has always been on taking wickets and making substantial contributions to the team, and I am grateful for the captain&#39;s trust in my abilities. While dropped catches are part and parcel of the game, they only strengthen my resolve to perform better. This victory is particularly momentous, marking a rare Test match on Indian soil, placing it among the top achievements for both the team and the fans. It serves as an inspiration for emerging players and underscores the importance and allure of Test cricket in India.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Captain: &quot;</strong><strong>This achievement is a testament to years of dedication and effort from our entire team and support staff. It&#39;s a collective reward for our hard work and perseverance. We aimed to maintain a positive approach in our play, exemplified by our strategic decision to place Richa Ghosh at no.3, known for her aggressive batting. Our focus was on adhering to the basics and executing our roles effectively. Personally, contributing with two crucial wickets was a result of our support staff&#39;s encouragement and strategy, emphasizing an offensive rather than a defensive approach from our bowlers. We are immensely grateful to the BCCI and the selectors for this opportunity and their trust in our abilities. Additionally, the consistent presence and support of the crowd over all four days have been incredibly encouraging. Our heartfelt thanks to everyone involved.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the second ODI against Australia at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. After sealing the Test series, the Indian women faced the Australians in the opening ODI at the same venue. India opted to bat first and put up a huge total of 282 runs, but the Australian women chased down the target. Can India turn victorious here and take the decider to the final match?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>AUSTRALIA WON THE TOSS AND OPTED TO BAT FIRST!</strong></span></p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1-10 Overs):-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Australia - 49/1 (4.9 rpo, 7x4, 0x6)&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India - 50/1 (5.0 rpo, 5x4, 1x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Middle Overs (11-40 Overs):-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Australia - 136/5 (4.5 rpo, 10x4, 1x6)&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India - 145/3 (4.8 rpo, 14x4, 0x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Death Overs (41-50 Overs):-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Australia - 73/2 (7.3 rpo, 1x4, 4x6)&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>||&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India - 60/4 (6.0 rpo, 6x4, 0x6)</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Australia, after winning the toss and electing to bat first, saw a strong start from Litchfield and Perry, each notching up half-centuries. This strong partnership set a solid foundation for the team. Despite the challenging conditions of the pitch, which favored the spinners, the middle-order batters contributed valuable runs, keeping the momentum going. Deepti Sharma from India exploited the pitch conditions masterfully, claiming five wickets with her spin bowling. Additionally, Alana King&#39;s crucial cameo towards the end of the innings boosted Australia to a competitive total, making the most of the 50 overs.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>On the chase, India faced early setbacks with Bhatia falling early and Mandhana unable to convert her start into a big score. However, Richa Ghosh and Jemimah Rodrigues steadied the ship with a resilient partnership, with Ghosh being particularly aggressive despite battling physical discomfort. Ghosh&#39;s innings was especially poignant as she fell just short of a century, a milestone that every batter cherishes. Jemimah&#39;s dismissal in the 34th over marked a turning point, as it broke a critical partnership at a crucial juncture of the game.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>As the innings progressed, the required run rate increased, and despite the efforts, the chase seemed to slip away from India. Ultimately, with 16 runs needed in the last over, the task proved too steep for the lower order, encapsulating the tension and drama that only cricket can offer. Australia will take the win and clinch the series!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Alyssa Healy, Australia captain: &quot;It got very close towards the end, but credit to our girls for discovering ways to triumph in difficult situations. We felt our score was somewhat lacking. Alana&#39;s hitting brought some momentum. Despite losing many wickets later on, we managed to take wickets and defend our total. There&#39;s something about Australian teams; we always hung in there. We maintained our belief that we could win until the very last ball, and that belief underpinned our success. Though we dropped catches and disappointed ourselves in some areas, our energy levels remained high. The past 12-18 months have brought many changes, yet the incoming players have stepped up and played significant roles, which is fantastic.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India captain: &quot;We executed our bowling strategy effectively. It was clear we needed to continuously seek out wickets. There are many positives to take from this. Even though they managed to swing the game in their favor, I&#39;m proud of how my team performed. A little more situational awareness towards the end of the chase would have been beneficial. Richa Ghosh played exceptionally well, with Jemimah Rodrigues supporting her in the middle. We&#39;re aware of Australia&#39;s extensive batting lineup. Keeping them under 300 was a notable achievement. We believed in our capacity to chase the total but needed to display more tactical acumen during the middle overs. Dropped catches are part of the game; what&#39;s important is how we recover from them.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Annabel Sutherland is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Annabel Sutherland: &quot;The game was thoroughly enjoyable, and it truly was a collective effort in the field. We focused on maintaining our composure throughout. Phoebe&#39;s catches were nothing short of sensational; she really stood out. Regarding my favorite wicket, I always aim to target the stumps, so bowling out Amanjot felt incredibly rewarding. It&#39;s gratifying to execute such plays towards the end, especially when the captain places such trust in me. My approach is to constantly analyze the game and adapt accordingly. I&#39;ve invested significant time working with the bowling coach, and the accumulation of practice and diverse international experiences has been invaluable. Initially, the pitch presented some challenges; it offered more spin and was slower compared to the previous match. Despite feeling that our score might have been below what we aimed for, Alana&#39;s extraordinary performance shifted the momentum in our favor. Phoebe&#39;s innings, though challenging, was crucial as she diligently worked to build the total we needed.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the third and final One Day International (ODI) between the women&#39;s teams of India and Australia at Mumbai&#39;s Wankhede Stadium. Australia, having won the first two matches, have already clinched the series, demonstrating remarkable skill, especially in batting. They managed a significant chase in the first game, marking it as the second-highest successful chase in women&#39;s ODI history. Despite being down in the series, the Indian team has shown resilience and strength. The two most notable performances from the Indian side: Deepti Sharma&#39;s incredible five wicket haul and Richa Ghosh&#39;s near-century. However, even with these impressive individual feats, the team struggled under pressure in the final moments of the second ODI, narrowly losing by three runs when they needed 35 off the last five overs. Although the series result is already decided, the upcoming match is far from inconsequential. For India, it&#39;s about regaining honor and pride, possibly breaking a long-standing streak since they haven&#39;t won a home ODI against Australia since February 2007. For Australia, it&#39;s about asserting total dominance and aiming for a clean sweep. Both teams have motivations beyond just the game at hand, with India fighting to rewrite a small piece of history and Australia looking to continue their winning legacy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>AUSTRALIA WON THE TOSS AND OPTED TO BAT FIRST!&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Alyssa Healy. &quot;We will have a bat first, The pitch looks quite dry, similar to what we played on in the first ODI. There&#39;s a change in the lineup: Darcie Brown is sitting out, and Megan Schutt is returning post a niggle. We&#39;re not fans of losing, so, indeed, we&#39;re aiming for 3-0. However, we can&#39;t underestimate this formidable Indian team.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur &quot;Great match to kick off the year, exuding positivity. &quot;We were aiming to bowl first. There&#39;s one alteration in the team - Sneh Rana is out due to an injury, and in her place, Mannat Kashyap will make her debut.

The home side posted 338 thanks to a rampant opening partnership between Litchfield (111) and Healy (94), later boosted by handy contributions from the middle and lower order.In response, India&#39;s chase never gained momentum as wickets tumbled at regular intervals. Opener Yastika fell cheaply while Smriti failed to capitalize on her start. None of the batting unit could construct a substantial, match-saving effort. Australia&#39;s disciplined bowling and electric fielding exacerbated the pressure as the visitors crumbled to 166 all out in just 40 overs.The lopsided result means India end the multi-format series on a disappointing note, unable to showcase the positive displays that earned them victory in the lone Test match.

We tried hard but fell short. Some excellent individual performances are contrasted by others needing self-analysis to drive improvement against top sides, especially in unforgiving white ball cricket where execution time is scarce.&nbsp;Now we swiftly shift focus to the T20 leg, carrying valuable learnings. The young blood has stood tall already; a huge booster. We know we can match Australia&#39;s batting and bowling skills. Gritty fielding remains the differential we must conquer urgently if dreams of overseas series wins will materialize. I remain buoyant. With disciplined execution, our best is yet to come.</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Pheobe Litchfield | Player of the Match and Player of the Series:&nbsp;While these individual accolades make me proud, our team&#39;s victory was truly an all-round effort. I&#39;ve learned immensely analyzing each innings. The first two were challenging but served as blueprint to improve - combined with some luck, I peaked when it mattered most today. Early assessment and adaptability to conditions proved key. Those catches felt natural after endless training reps engraining the instinct, though they sure seemed flashy! A 3-0 ODI sweep feels incredible, especially bouncing back in style from the lone Test defeat. This triumph should launch us onto bigger things in 2024. I&rsquo;m just tremendously grateful for the opportunity and support systems lifting my game.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Alyssa Healy&nbsp;A dominant 3-0 whitewash feels gratifying. With three T20s remaining, we won&#39;t relax - it&#39;s about sustaining intensity. After subpar fielding initially, we had a point to prove and lifted our game. Litchfield never ceases to amaze me. Bagging two ODI tons at just 20 leaves me shaking my head! She prides herself as our best fielder and fully showcased her skills today. Witnessing her graceful strokeplay up close is truly my privilege.&nbsp;Whenever the team needs someone to stand up, these world class bowlers unfailingly answer the call. Can&#39;t ask for better squad depth and talent. We&#39;re already refocusing on the T20 mission ahead.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Meanwhile, Australia, riding high from their recent ODI victories, looks forward to Phoebe Litchfield&#39;s continued dominance at the crease.

India rejuvenated from their emphatic victory in the T20I opener, is poised for another spectacular showdown against Australia. The collective prowess of India&#39;s bowlers, who restricted Australia to 141, coupled with a dominant batting performance, has set the tone for an intense series. With eyes set on a series victory, the host team leans heavily on their bowling unit, featuring promising talents like Shreyanka Patil and Titas Sadhu, alongside seasoned campaigners finding their groove. The DY Patil Stadium&#39;s balanced pitch, with its nuances favoring the batters in the second innings due to dew, awaits another epic encounter. As both teams prepare for the 2nd T20I, the anticipation for a cricketing spectacle under Navi Mumbai&#39;s lights is palpable&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn the head-to-head T20I record, Australia historically holds an advantage with 23 victories against India&#39;s six from 31 encounters. However, India&#39;s recent triumph in the opening match of the current series signifies a potential shift in momentum, indicating a more competitive rivalry ahead.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS<span style=\"color:#f39c12\">: Australia won the toss and elected to field first&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/toss_1704635902.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nAlyssa Healy, Australia captain: We&#39;ve decided to bowl first.

This victory holds historical significance as it marks the first time that India has lost a three-match T20I series after initially taking a 1-0 lead.&nbsp;After losing the toss and being asked to bat first, India witnessed promising starts from their top-order batters, Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana. However, both players couldn&#39;t capitalize on their starts, unable to convert them into substantial scores. The top-order duo of Jemimah Rodrigues and Harmanpreet Kaur were also dismissed shortly. Despite the early setbacks, India Women managed to stage a commendable recovery, especially considering they were at 66/4 at the halfway point of their innings. The partnership between Richa Ghosh and Deepti Sharma for the fifth wicket provided stability, but it was eventually disrupted by a breakthrough from Wareham. In the latter stages of the innings, Ghosh and Amanjot Kaur struck a few crucial boundaries, helping India breach the 140-run mark.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Australia&#39;s reply saw Alyssa Healy taking her time to adapt to the conditions. Once she found her rhythm, there was no looking back. The aggressive Australian captain played her natural game, nearly dismantling the chase within the first 10 overs. Although Healy was dismissed on 38, the decision was inconclusive, and she provided few chances during her innings. Throughout the chase, Beth Mooney&#39;s role was pivotal. She held one end, allowing her teammates to contribute and play their part effectively. This strategy worked to perfection, leading Australia to a comprehensive victory. Notably, this series win marked a significant achievement for Alyssa Healy, who was playing her 150th T20I. It was her first T20I series victory as a full-time captain.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur|India Captain: The past month has seen some quality cricket from us.

I&#39;m proud of our youngsters; they&#39;ve given their all whenever called upon. We always challenge our opponents, and our unity is a strength.

It&#39;s vital to get a solid start in chases, and I&#39;m proud of how we managed the run rate. With 9 bowling options, our confidence in consistently using just 5 in the last games is commendable. I&#39;m fortunate to lead such a talented group. We&#39;re now looking forward to a multi-format series against South Africa back home.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

The series starts with the WODI leg at Bengaluru before moving on to the Only Test and WT20I series at Chennai. Harmanpreet Kaur and the Women in Blue will look to start this 3 match series on a winning note and try out their combinations and preparations as a leadup to next year&#39;s WODI World Cup in India.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The last time the two teams met was in the ICC Women&#39;s World Cup in 2022, where South Africa had edged a last-ball thriller against the Women in Blue.

I thought 260 was a fairly decent score. We just needed one person to bat through, and it was fairly chasable. I think we could have been a little bit better with our control but I thought 265 wasn&#39;t too bad. I think being 30 for three is probably not ideal and we definitely need to regroup.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur, India Skipper:</span> </strong>&quot;It was a good team performance. We showed good energy. We have a long batting order and we know everybody cannot contribute. 2-3 players do the job and today Smriti, Deepti and Pooja did that for us. The allrounders love the format as you have time to execute your plans. Very happy with their performance and contribution to the team. We already discussed going with 5 bowlers and maybe myself, Hemalatha or Shafali will bowl 2 or 3 overs if needed. Hoping that Pooja is fine and the injury is not that bad.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana: </strong></span>&quot;I&#39;m really happy that I could contribute and as we discussed, starting the series well is the most important thing. So I&#39;m really pleased that we achieved a hundred-plus run victory, nothing could be better than that. Today it was about playing the situation again. We lost a few wickets in the middle, so it was crucial to build a partnership. Credit to Deepti and Pooja, whenever they came in they kept the scoreboard moving which really helped us as set batters.&quot;</p>\n",

I thought 260 was a fairly decent score. We just needed one person to bat through, and it was fairly chasable. I think we could have been a little bit better with our control but I thought 265 wasn&#39;t too bad. I think being 30 for three is probably not ideal and we definitely need to regroup.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur, India Skipper:</span> </strong>&quot;It was a good team performance. We showed good energy. We have a long batting order and we know everybody cannot contribute. 2-3 players do the job and today Smriti, Deepti and Pooja did that for us. The allrounders love the format as you have time to execute your plans. Very happy with their performance and contribution to the team. We already discussed going with 5 bowlers and maybe myself, Hemalatha or Shafali will bowl 2 or 3 overs if needed. Hoping that Pooja is fine and the injury is not that bad.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana: </strong></span>&quot;I&#39;m really happy that I could contribute and as we discussed, starting the series well is the most important thing. So I&#39;m really pleased that we achieved a hundred-plus run victory, nothing could be better than that. Today it was about playing the situation again. We lost a few wickets in the middle, so it was crucial to build a partnership. Credit to Deepti and Pooja, whenever they came in they kept the scoreboard moving which really helped us as set batters.&quot;</p>\n",

The Women in Blue will look to make it a clean sweep against South Africa and look to head into the Test and WT20I legs with momentum. The Harmanpreet-led side dominated the first WODI and etched a nervy thriller in the 2nd game of the series, with vice-captain Smriti Mandhana notching up centuries in both games and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur also getting a hundred in the previous match. Can Smriti get her third consecutive hundred and make her way into the record books as the player with the most WODI hundreds for India today?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>WV Raman &amp; Dane van Niekerk:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s 59m on the offside, 57m on the leg side and 66m down the ground. There was variable bounce on the wicket in the first ODI and we are back on the same wicket for this game. There&#39;s less grass on this wicket and it&#39;s going to crumble later on. Overall, it&#39;s a good wicket and there are a lot of runs to be had.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>South Africa have won the toss and will bat first!</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>\n",

In the chase, Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma got India off to yet another powerful start in the Powerplay, scoring 53 runs without losing a wicket, after which the Indian vice-captain continued her purple patch and went on to notch up her third consecutive half-century of the series.

Join us on 28th June for the first day of the Test match!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\">Laura Wolvaardt, South Africa Captain:</span> </strong>&quot;Didn&#39;t have enough runs on the board, we had a good start and unfortunately lost many wickets in the middle and did not build any partnerships. We have played good cricket in patches and need to be a lot more consistent. We don&#39;t play too much red-ball cricket, have a few days to refresh and get onto the Test plans. I am really excited and looking forward to it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian Captain:</span> </strong>&quot;The last few camps we had gave us a lot of confidence. Credit goes to the bowlers, they have been outstanding today. I tell the bowlers to stick to their strength and just give them confidence and the field placement as they want. We will enjoy our win tonight, but there is a Test match and then a T20 series coming up, so we need to think about our plans for that as well.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Deepti Sharma:</span> </strong>&quot;Really enjoyed bowling today and we executed our plans perfectly. I always back my stock ball and stay ready for all kinds of situations. Sometimes you need to contain the batters, so I try to read the situation, keeping the pitch and conditions in mind as well.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana is the Player of the Series</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Smriti Mandhana:</span> </strong>&quot;Unfortunate to miss out on a 100 today. The bowlers bowled well and for us, it was just about applying ourselves with the bat. We have a series left, the Asia Cup and then the World Cup. I tried my hand in the previous game and got lucky, always good to add a different skill and if my bowling comes off then it is the best feeling.&quot;</p>\n",

There was variable bounce on the wicket in the first ODI and we are back on the same wicket for this game. There&#39;s less grass on this wicket and it&#39;s going to crumble later on. Overall, it&#39;s a good wicket and there are a lot of runs to be had.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>South Africa have won the toss and will bat first!</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>\n",

We have played good cricket in patches and need to be a lot more consistent. We don&#39;t play too much red-ball cricket, have a few days to refresh and get onto the Test plans.

Credit goes to the bowlers, they have been outstanding today. I tell the bowlers to stick to their strength and just give them confidence and the field placement as they want. We will enjoy our win tonight, but there is a Test match and then a T20 series coming up, so we need to think about our plans for that as well.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Deepti Sharma:</span> </strong>&quot;Really enjoyed bowling today and we executed our plans perfectly. I always back my stock ball and stay ready for all kinds of situations. Sometimes you need to contain the batters, so I try to read the situation, keeping the pitch and conditions in mind as well.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana is the Player of the Series</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Smriti Mandhana:</span> </strong>&quot;Unfortunate to miss out on a 100 today. The bowlers bowled well and for us, it was just about applying ourselves with the bat. We have a series left, the Asia Cup and then the World Cup. I tried my hand in the previous game and got lucky, always good to add a different skill and if my bowling comes off then it is the best feeling.&quot;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Excitement is brewing in Chennai as the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium gears up to host a highly anticipated one-off Test between India Women and South Africa Women. This match holds special significance for India, marking their return to this iconic venue after a 16-year hiatus.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India arrives brimming with confidence after conquering formidable opponents like England and Australia in recent Tests. Additionally, their ODI series win against South Africa bolsters their morale. Their potent spin attack, a key factor in those victories, holds a potential advantage on the spin-friendly Chennai surface. Smriti Mandhana&#39;s batting prowess, coupled with the phenomenal form of Deepti Sharma and Arundhati Reddy, further strengthens the home team&#39;s resolve.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>South Africa, on the other hand, seeks redemption after a crushing innings defeat against Australia earlier this year. Limited red-ball preparation in their domestic circuit adds to the challenge. They will heavily rely on the seasoned all-rounder Marizanne Kapp to guide their relatively young squad. Exemplary performances from key players like Laura Wolvaardt and the pace bowling unit, spearheaded by Kapp, are crucial ingredients for South Africa to put up a competitive fight against the formidable Indian team.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This Test is enriched by its historical context and the backdrop of previous encounters where India has usually held the upper hand. Both teams boast a captivating mix of seasoned campaigners and rising talents, making the matchup an exciting spectacle for cricket enthusiasts worldwide. With the Chennai pitch traditionally favoring spinners, the strategic battle between India&#39;s spin attack and South Africa&#39;s batting will likely shape the outcome of this captivating Test.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Pitch Report (WV Raman)<br />\n&quot;It&#39;s time for the good old format at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The pitch here is made entirely of red soil and looks very well prepared. It&#39;s hard, and in fact, the curator told me they spent 15 days preparing this pitch.As such, there will be bounce on the opening day, but it will gradually recede as the game progresses, and we&#39;ll see the spinners coming into play later on. However, the biggest challenge for the bowlers will be the fact that they need to bowl 100 overs in a day.So, it will be a test of discipline and mental stamina. As for the batters, if they can get through the first 20 minutes, it&#39;s going to be a great time for them, because the bounce will be true on the surface for the first two days. Therefore, we can expect high-quality cricket in this Test match.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-06-28T093518_1719547814.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Skipper:&quot;We&#39;re going to bat first.

That&#39;s what we discussed in the team meetings as well. Whatever gave us the results, we just want to keep doing it. We have an unfortunate change. Yastika is not playing, and in her place, Shubha Satheesh is playing.I think we just want to keep things very simple because, at the end of the day, it&#39;s cricket, and we just want to keep doing what we have been doing for so many years.

Eliz-mari Marx and Tazmin Brits are missing out due to illness, but Annerie Dercksen is making her debut today.

Laura Wolvaardt (122) and Sune Luus (109) added 190 runs for the second wicket, but the middle order faltered again. Nadine de Klerk&rsquo;s valiant 61 helped them reach 373, setting a low target of just 37 runs for the Women in Blue. Sneh Rana got a couple of wickets and completed a 10-wicket haul in the Test.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India chased down the target without losing a wicket, with Shubha Satheesh fittingly hitting the winning runs. The victory highlighted India&rsquo;s dominance, with key performances from both bat and ball ensuring a memorable win at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Laura Wolvaardt |&nbsp; South Africa Skipper: &quot;The character shown by the group has been incredible. To concede 500 runs on day one was not ideal, and not many people felt we could take it into day four. I&#39;m very proud of the group. There are a lot of little areas you can look at. We were fighting very hard to get the draw. Each batter feels they could have hung around a little longer. Had we restricted them to a lower total, there are lots of moments we can look at. Each and every batter had the mindset to bat as long as they could. Players like Nadine and Marizanne, who are known for their attacking batting, the way they grafted was very heart-warming. I thought we had it at the end of yesterday and was really hoping we could see it out.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;Sneh Rana (Player of the Match):&quot;Feeling really great to contribute on such an occasion. It&#39;s tough to describe in words. My body is quite fresh after fielding for so many overs. Initially, the pitch was difficult for spinners with not much turn, but later on, we got a lot of turn and bounce. The South African batters balanced the game well, but our bowling attack fought back strongly.Playing a Test match is a big deal and very special. Winning this award is beyond description. I also want to say one thing: People often say that playing off-spinners is very easy, but I hope those people got an answer today.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;Harmanpreet Kaur | India Skipper:&quot;They batted really well. They didn&#39;t give us an easy win; we had to work hard. Credit goes to Shafali and Smriti first. Secondly, everyone contributed with the bat. It wasn&#39;t easy to field in this heat, but everyone did their part. The skippers kept believing that we could take those wickets and win the game. All of them, especially the spinners, the way they played the last two matches, they knew they could create chances. Even the medium-pacers did their job. The support staff had positive talks and kept pushing us, creating a very good atmosphere. It was a bit tough to rotate three spinners. I was eager to keep giving them the ball. Shafali and I chipped in as well. Everyone bowled well, and I&#39;m really happy with the performance. When we came in, we knew we only had 100 runs in the pocket. We had to be careful but also needed to keep looking for wickets. We planned really well and stuck to it.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Excitement is brewing in Chennai as the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium gears up to host a highly anticipated one-off Test between India Women and South Africa Women. This match holds special significance for India, marking their return to this iconic venue after a 16-year hiatus.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India arrives brimming with confidence after conquering formidable opponents like England and Australia in recent Tests. Additionally, their ODI series win against South Africa bolsters their morale. Their potent spin attack, a key factor in those victories, holds a potential advantage on the spin-friendly Chennai surface. Smriti Mandhana&#39;s batting prowess, coupled with the phenomenal form of Deepti Sharma and Arundhati Reddy, further strengthens the home team&#39;s resolve.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>South Africa, on the other hand, seeks redemption after a crushing innings defeat against Australia earlier this year. Limited red-ball preparation in their domestic circuit adds to the challenge. They will heavily rely on the seasoned all-rounder Marizanne Kapp to guide their relatively young squad. Exemplary performances from key players like Laura Wolvaardt and the pace bowling unit, spearheaded by Kapp, are crucial ingredients for South Africa to put up a competitive fight against the formidable Indian team.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This Test is enriched by its historical context and the backdrop of previous encounters where India has usually held the upper hand. Both teams boast a captivating mix of seasoned campaigners and rising talents, making the matchup an exciting spectacle for cricket enthusiasts worldwide. With the Chennai pitch traditionally favoring spinners, the strategic battle between India&#39;s spin attack and South Africa&#39;s batting will likely shape the outcome of this captivating Test.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Pitch Report (WV Raman)<br />\n&quot;It&#39;s time for the good old format at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The pitch here is made entirely of red soil and looks very well prepared. It&#39;s hard, and in fact, the curator told me they spent 15 days preparing this pitch.As such, there will be bounce on the opening day, but it will gradually recede as the game progresses, and we&#39;ll see the spinners coming into play later on. However, the biggest challenge for the bowlers will be the fact that they need to bowl 100 overs in a day.So, it will be a test of discipline and mental stamina. As for the batters, if they can get through the first 20 minutes, it&#39;s going to be a great time for them, because the bounce will be true on the surface for the first two days. Therefore, we can expect high-quality cricket in this Test match.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-06-28T093518_1719547814.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Skipper:&quot;We&#39;re going to bat first. Looking at the conditions, I think batting first will be a good option for us.We just want to keep doing the same things because, last time when we played Test matches, those things gave us the results. That&#39;s what we discussed in the team meetings as well. Whatever gave us the results, we just want to keep doing it. We have an unfortunate change. Yastika is not playing, and in her place, Shubha Satheesh is playing.I think we just want to keep things very simple because, at the end of the day, it&#39;s cricket, and we just want to keep doing what we have been doing for so many years. I know red-ball cricket brings a lot of excitement, and we just want to embrace that excitement.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Laura Wolvaardt |&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>South Africa Skipper:<br />\n&quot;Yeah, it is an awesome opportunity for us. We have three Test matches in this calendar year, and it&#39;s amazing to have more Test cricket. We&#39;re really looking forward to it. Yes, we have a few illnesses going around in our squad. Eliz-mari Marx and Tazmin Brits are missing out due to illness, but Annerie Dercksen is making her debut today. We&#39;ve had a few days of good preparation, and we know spin will play a huge factor here, so we practiced a lot of spin in the nets.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Opting to bat first, India declared at a formidable 603/6, thanks to stellar performances from Shafali Verma (205) and Smriti Mandhana (149). Their record 292-run opening partnership set the tone, with contributions from Harmanpreet Kaur (69) and Richa Ghosh (86) bolstering the total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>South Africa struggled in their first innings, managing only 266 runs.

Laura Wolvaardt (122) and Sune Luus (109) added 190 runs for the second wicket, but the middle order faltered again. Nadine de Klerk&rsquo;s valiant 61 helped them reach 373, setting a low target of just 37 runs for the Women in Blue. Sneh Rana got a couple of wickets and completed a 10-wicket haul in the Test.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India chased down the target without losing a wicket, with Shubha Satheesh fittingly hitting the winning runs. The victory highlighted India&rsquo;s dominance, with key performances from both bat and ball ensuring a memorable win at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Laura Wolvaardt |&nbsp; South Africa Skipper: &quot;The character shown by the group has been incredible. To concede 500 runs on day one was not ideal, and not many people felt we could take it into day four. I&#39;m very proud of the group. There are a lot of little areas you can look at. We were fighting very hard to get the draw. Each batter feels they could have hung around a little longer. Had we restricted them to a lower total, there are lots of moments we can look at. Each and every batter had the mindset to bat as long as they could. Players like Nadine and Marizanne, who are known for their attacking batting, the way they grafted was very heart-warming. I thought we had it at the end of yesterday and was really hoping we could see it out.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;Sneh Rana (Player of the Match):&quot;Feeling really great to contribute on such an occasion. It&#39;s tough to describe in words. My body is quite fresh after fielding for so many overs. Initially, the pitch was difficult for spinners with not much turn, but later on, we got a lot of turn and bounce. The South African batters balanced the game well, but our bowling attack fought back strongly.Playing a Test match is a big deal and very special. Winning this award is beyond description. I also want to say one thing: People often say that playing off-spinners is very easy, but I hope those people got an answer today.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;Harmanpreet Kaur | India Skipper:&quot;They batted really well. They didn&#39;t give us an easy win; we had to work hard. Credit goes to Shafali and Smriti first. Secondly, everyone contributed with the bat. It wasn&#39;t easy to field in this heat, but everyone did their part. The skippers kept believing that we could take those wickets and win the game. All of them, especially the spinners, the way they played the last two matches, they knew they could create chances. Even the medium-pacers did their job. The support staff had positive talks and kept pushing us, creating a very good atmosphere. It was a bit tough to rotate three spinners. I was eager to keep giving them the ball. Shafali and I chipped in as well. Everyone bowled well, and I&#39;m really happy with the performance. When we came in, we knew we only had 100 runs in the pocket. We had to be careful but also needed to keep looking for wickets. We planned really well and stuck to it.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

India has dominated thus far, sweeping the ODI series 3-0 and securing a ten-wicket victory in the one-off Test. With the T20I series, South Africa aims to turn the tide and end the tour on a high note.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Led by the ever-dynamic Harmanpreet Kaur, the Women in Blue are in superb form. Smriti Mandhana has been sensational, scoring heavily across formats and setting the tone for India&#39;s batting. Radha Yadav, after a stellar WPL, has returned to the national side with a bang, becoming India&#39;s top wicket-taker in the recent Bangladesh series. The squad, a blend of experienced players like Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Deepti Sharma, looks well-balanced and formidable.Despite showing glimpses of brilliance, the Proteas have struggled for consistency.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The MA Chidambaram Stadium is known for its spin-friendly conditions, but recent rains could make the pitch unpredictableEvening dew could play a significant role, making chasing a strategic choice.With high stakes and intense competition, this series promises to be a gripping contest.

With the visitors leading 1-0, the hosts are poised for a spirited comeback in this T20 decider that promises more excitement than a last-ball six.After rain played spoilsport in the second T20I, leaving fans as unsatisfied as a batter stranded on 99, both teams are raring to go. India, led by the dynamic Harmanpreet Kaur, is looking to summon the fighting spirit that saw them dominate the ODIs and Test matches earlier in the tour. The Indian bowling attack, spearheaded by the ever-reliable Deepti Sharma and Pooja Vastrakar, showed marked improvement in the last match. Deepti&#39;s middle-overs magic and Pooja Vastrakar&#39;s workhorse performance have given the team a boost. Now, if they can tighten the screws in the powerplay and death overs, they&#39;ll make life hard for the Protean Batters in the middle.<br />\n<br />\nThe hosts&#39; batting lineup remains intriguingly poised. Whatever the combination, expect India to come out swinging harder than Kapil Dev in his heyday. South Africa, to their credit, have found their T20 mojo at the right time. Tazmin Brits has been in red-hot form, and skipper Laura Wolvaardt continues to lead from the front. The Proteas have proven they&#39;re no pushovers, adding a delicious tension to this series finale.As the start time approaches, all eyes will be on the sky, hoping the weather plays fair.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>So,get ready for a match that promises more drama than a Bollywood blockbuster and more twists than a mystery novel. Will India level the series with a home-ground flourish, or will South Africa complete their T20 triumph?

Shafali Verma (40 off 29) and Smriti Mandhana (45 off 31) opened with a bang, smashing boundaries like it was a warm-up session. Despite a couple of quick wickets, Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues ensured a smooth finish, wrapping up the game in 14.1 overs. Renuka Singh shone with 2 wickets for 14 runs, Deepti Sharma dazzled with 3 for 20, and Smriti Mandhana lit up the innings with her 45 runs off 31 balls. The Women in Blue have set the tone for the tournament, showing why they are the team to beat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Nida Dar | Pakistan Captain:&quot;Well, the difference was in the powerplays. We lost both powerplays. We came back well but struggled for the majority of the game. I think we have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a strategy for the next game. Definitely, we need to plan better for the next matches. We can come back in the remaining two games.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of The Match: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Deepti Sharma</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Deepti Sharma:&quot; Really happy with the performance tonight. I executed my plan well and am pleased with the result. As a unit, we worked really hard, and after the South Africa series, I focused a lot on my bowling, so I&#39;m happy with how I bowled tonight.It&#39;s always a wonderful feeling to take the wicket of their best batter, and I was very happy to dismiss Nida Dar.I didn&#39;t know about the milestone, but I&#39;m happy with my performance.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:&quot;Well, our bowlers and openers made it happen. The first game is always a pressure game, but we got the job done. It&#39;s important to set the tone in the first game, and whoever got the opportunity did well. When bowling, we talked about getting early wickets, and our bowlers delivered. Smriti and Shafali gave us a good start. As for the takeaway from this tournament ahead of the T20 World Cup, we just want to play well, give our best in the remainder of this tournament, and then think about the World Cup later.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n",

Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma are in top form, and their bowlers are putting immense pressure on opponents.UAE, after a tough loss to Nepal, need a win to stay in the tournament. Their top-order batters must set a strong foundation, with middle-order players like Kavisha Egodage and Khushi Sharma stepping up. The big question: Can the UAE team pull off an upset, or will Harmanpreet Kaur&rsquo;s squad continue their dominant run? Stay tuned for this thrilling encounter!</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">UAE Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nEsha Rohit Oza | UAE Captain:<br />\n&quot;We want to bowl first.

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur anchored the innings with a steady 66 off 47 balls, while Smriti Mandhana added a quick 13 off 9.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>It&rsquo;s the final showdown in Group A of the Women&rsquo;s Asia Cup! Unbeaten India face Nepal at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium today, July 23. With a semifinal spot on the line, Harmanpreet Kaur&rsquo;s squad is laser-focused on clinching a win.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India is currently leading the points table with two wins from two matches, totalling 4 points. Their performance has been dominant, with the bowlers setting the tone against Pakistan and the batters shining against the UAE. Key contributions from players like Shafali Verma, Richa Ghosh, and Harmanpreet Kaur have been crucial. Despite losing Shreyanka Patil to injury, Tanuja Kanwer has stepped up admirably. Consistent performances from Renuka Singh, Pooja Vastrakar, and Deepti Sharma have been the backbone of their success.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWith high stakes, Nepal aims to channel their early success and challenge the defending champions. For India, a win secures their semifinal spot and reinforces their status as tournament favourites. Will Nepal rise to the occasion, or will India continue their dominant run?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Smriti Mandhana | India Captain:&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;We would like to bat first today. In the last few years, T20 has changed, so it&#39;s a collective effort to attack. Whatever is in the batter&#39;s range, they go after it. The outfield is really quick, and sometimes even 200 is not enough.</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">We are really looking forward to trusting the process. We aim to bat well for the full 20 overs. Anything above 180 would be great. It&#39;s not about thinking too far ahead, but about focusing on each ball at a time.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&nbsp;Indu Barma | Nepal Captain:</strong><strong>&quot;We are ready for both batting and bowling. We have some eager youngsters ready to join the competition. We&#39;re prepared for any challenge and will give our all. We&#39;ve made two changes.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Opting to bat first, India posted a formidable 178/3 in their 20 overs, led by a blistering 81 off 48 balls from Shafali Verma. Dayalan Hemalatha added 47 off 42 balls, while Jemimah Rodrigues&rsquo; quickfire 28 off 15 balls provided the finishing touches.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nepal&#39;s bowlers struggled to contain the Indian batters, with Sita Rana Magar (2/25) being the standout performer. Chasing 179, Nepal could only manage 96/9 in their 20 overs. Arundhati Reddy struck early, removing both openers, and Deepti Sharma spun a web around the Nepal batters, claiming 3 wickets for 13 runs. Radha Yadav also chipped in with 2 wickets, ensuring a smooth passage for India to the semis.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Shafali Verma&rsquo;s explosive innings and Deepti Sharma&rsquo;s stellar bowling highlighted India&#39;s all-round dominance. With this emphatic win, India have sent a strong message to their rivals: they are here to win.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Indu Barma | Nepal&nbsp; Captain:&quot;I am proud of the team. We have realized our weaknesses and we will come back stronger. We respect our opponents. We got great exposure playing against India.I am happy with my team. After the 10th over, our bowlers gained good momentum. I got lots of experience, and my teammates gained a bunch of experience playing against India and Pakistan.

I&#39;m becoming more consistent and working on finishing strong. I saw the fielder and aimed to hit the ball along the ground. Scoring 200 runs is significant for a batter, and since I wasn&#39;t in great form before, this innings really boosted my confidence.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana | India Captain:&quot; As an opener, it&rsquo;s rare not to get a chance to bat, so I&#39;m really happy with how things went. Shafali batted brilliantly, and Hema also got some runs. We finished well as a team. I think it was much-needed game time for all the batters, especially since the middle order hasn&rsquo;t had many opportunities to bat in the last two T20 series. So, I was really happy with how it turned out, and we finished off well too.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n",

With a spot in the grand finale at stake, anticipation is high. India have been dominant throughout the tournament. Led by the dynamic Harmanpreet Kaur, they have cruised through the group stage with convincing wins over Pakistan, the UAE, and Nepal. Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma have been explosive at the top, while Jemimah Rodrigues and Richa Ghosh have provided solidity in the middle.<br />\n<br />\nThe Indian bowlers, led by Renuka Singh, Deepti Sharma, and Radha Yadav, have been clinical, consistently dismantling opposition lineups. After a shaky start against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh bounced back with wins over Thailand and Malaysia to secure their semi-final spot. India&#39;s historical dominance over Bangladesh in T20Is adds to their confidence. This match will test Bangladesh&rsquo;s ability to counter India&rsquo;s formidable bowling attack. With clear skies and perfect cricketing conditions, we can expect an exciting semi-final.</strong></p>\n",

After winning the toss and opting to bat, Bangladesh struggled to find momentum. Renuka Singh Thakur&#39;s exceptional spell of 3/10 in four overs set the tone early, dismantling the top order. Nigar Sultana, the captain, managed a gritty 32 off 51 balls but received little support from her teammates. Radha Yadav also shone with the ball, claiming 3/14 as Bangladesh limped to 80/8 in their 20 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing a modest target of 81, India&rsquo;s openers Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana made light work of the Bangladeshi bowlers.

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>As the sun rises on another thrilling Asia Cup final, the stage is set for a clash of titans. India, the perennial powerhouse, are poised to defend their crown against a determined Sri Lankan side eager to rewrite history.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s journey to the final has been nothing short of spectacular. They&rsquo;ve steamrolled their way through the competition, leaving a trail of defeated teams in their wake. Their 10-wicket demolition of Bangladesh in the semifinals was a testament to their dominance, even with a shuffled lineup. D Hemalatha has been a revelation at no. 3, stepping up in the absence of Smriti Mandhana, while Deepti Sharma&rsquo;s precision with the ball has been unmatched. Shafali Verma and Renuka Thakur have found their rhythm, and Tanuja Kanwer&rsquo;s tight spells have added depth to an already formidable squad.On the other side, Sri Lanka, under the leadership of Chamari Athapaththu, have been equally impressive. Athapaththu&rsquo;s blazing form, earning her three Player of the Match awards, has been the cornerstone of their campaign.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The memory of last year&rsquo;s one-sided final still lingers, but this time, Sri Lanka has the advantage of home support. They are more than ready to challenge India&rsquo;s supremacy and carve out a historic victory.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Will India continue their reign, or will Sri Lanka rise to the occasion and claim the title?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat first&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain: &quot;We are going to bat first. Both the semis were played on this pitch, which is why we chose to bat first. We worked hard, and that&#39;s why our batting line-up looks strong. They are a good side, but we are focused on what we need to do. We are playing with an unchanged 11.</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff3300\"><strong>Chamari Athapaththu | Sri Lanka Captain:&quot;If we had won the toss, we were looking to bowl first. We need to improve our fielding, and hopefully, our batters will perform well. We&#39;re about 80 percent satisfied. We have one change in our lineup.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Smriti Mandhana was the top scorer with a well-crafted 60 off 47 balls, while Richa Ghosh added a quick 30 off 14 deliveries. Kavisha Dilhari was the pick of the bowlers for Sri Lanka, taking 2 wickets for 36 runs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Sri Lanka had a shaky start, losing Vishmi Gunaratne early. However, captain Chamari Athapaththu played a captain&#39;s knock, scoring a brilliant 61 off 43 balls, including nine fours and two sixes. Harshitha Samarawickrama provided excellent support with an unbeaten 69 off 51 balls, and Kavisha Dilhari&rsquo;s rapid 30 off 16 balls ensured Sri Lanka reached the target with ease, finishing at 167/2 in 18.4 overs. The victory sparked jubilant celebrations as the entire Sri Lankan squad charged onto the field, outclassing the 7-time champions and delighting the crowd in Dambulla.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:&quot;I think we played good cricket throughout the tournament, but we did make a few fumbles in the field, and that is what cost us.The powerplay went our way, but no doubt they played well and didn&#39;t give us much chance.Definitely, we need to improve for the World Cup now.

Special thanks to Harshita and Dilhari for their performances. It&#39;s not a one-man show; the coaching staff has been great, and finally, we have won the Asia Cup&mdash;special thanks to the Sri Lankan crowd for their support. I&#39;m really happy.

Led by Harmanpreet Kaur, the squad has a strong blend of experience and youthful firepower, ready to dominate the competition.<br />\n<br />\nIndia&rsquo;s batting lineup boasts heavyweights like Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana, and Kaur herself, all eager to regain form after a mixed bag in warm-ups. The key anchor, Jemimah Rodrigues, brings stability to the middle order, while the hard-hitting Richa Ghosh and dependable Deepti Sharma offer finishing power.<br />\n<br />\nTheir first challenge is New Zealand, a team looking to reverse a poor run of form. While the White Ferns have struggled recently, they still have match-winners like Sophie Devine and Amelia Kerr, and can&rsquo;t be underestimated.<br />\n<br />\nIndia&rsquo;s bowling attack, led by a potent spin trio&mdash;Deepti Sharma, Radha Yadav, and Shreyanka Patil&mdash;will look to exploit Dubai&rsquo;s turning pitches. Renuka Singh Thakur spearheads the pace department, adding versatility to the attack.<br />\n<br />\nIndia know that a strong start is critical in this World Cup and they&rsquo;ll be determined to make an early statement. Stay tuned as India kicks off its quest for glory in what promises to be an exhilarating World Cup!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20 World Cup</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (13)_1728048052.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Nasser Hussain and WV Raman:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nasser: &quot;We&#39;re here for the second game of this double-header. The ground looks in great shape, and it&#39;s cooled down a bit. Temperatures should drop to around 31 degrees Celsius as we head into the night. Let&rsquo;s talk about the ground dimensions&mdash;53m and 63m for the square boundaries, while the straight hit is 73m. Definitely some shorter areas to target. I&#39;ve got WV Raman with me. What&rsquo;s your take on the pitch? Do you expect it to change as the game goes on?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Raman: &quot;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see much change. There&rsquo;s plenty of dry grass on the surface, which suggests we&rsquo;ll get some bounce and pace. Later on, we might see a bit of turn, but I don&#39;t expect dew to be a factor tonight.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: New Zealand Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sophie Devine | New Zealand Captain:<br />\n&quot;We&#39;re happy to bat first tonight on this fresh surface and are excited to give it a go.Our preparation has been good, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to starting our campaign. After watching the previous game, we know the pitch might play a bit slower, but we&rsquo;ll focus on taking regular wickets to maintain control.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:<br />\n&quot;We would have chosen to bat first too. We aim to go out and play quality cricket.All our players have a fearless approach. They&#39;re always looking to take the aggressive option, and I love that. I believe this is the best team we&#39;ve had for a T20 World Cup.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Opting to bat first, the White Ferns got off to a flying start with Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer laying a solid foundation. Despite a mid-innings wobble against spin, captain Sophie Devine&#39;s unbeaten 57 off 36 balls steered New Zealand to a formidable 160/4.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&#39;s chase faltered from the outset, losing key wickets in the powerplay including Shafali Verma, Harmanpreet Kaur, and Smriti Mandhana. The asking rate climbed steadily as New Zealand&#39;s bowlers maintained pressure. Lea Tahuhu (3/15) and Rosemary Mair (4/19) were particularly impressive, systematically dismantling India&#39;s batting lineup. India were eventually bowled out for 102 in 19 overs, falling well short of the target.<br />\n&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;We definitely didn&rsquo;t play our best cricket today. Moving forward, we need to focus on the areas where we can improve and bring our A-game in the upcoming matches.We created chances, but unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t capitalize on them. Credit to New Zealand&mdash;they played better cricket. Our bowlers did a decent job, but fielding errors cost us. In high-pressure games like this, you can&rsquo;t afford those mistakes.We&rsquo;ve chased 160-170 targets before, but today we weren&rsquo;t expecting 160 on this pitch. I feel we gave away 10-15 extra runs. Losing wickets regularly hurt us, and going forward, we need to learn how to handle such situations better.That said, we still managed to keep them in check after their strong start. I thought they were on track for 180, but we pulled it back. This is a tough group, and though it&#39;s not the start we wanted, we need to regroup and work on both our bowling and batting strategies.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Sophie Devine | Player of the Match &amp; New Zealand Captain:</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>&quot;Honestly, the foundation set by Bates and Plimmer got us going. We talked about maximizing the middle overs, around 7-12, and while we slowed down a bit, I&rsquo;m happy we pushed through to post a good total in the end. The pitch wasn&rsquo;t easy to bat on, especially with pace off, making it tough to find gaps. I had to muscle a few shots to get to the boundary, but I knew if I spent time in the middle, I could catch up later. This team has worked incredibly hard over the past six months, and it&rsquo;s great to see it paying off today. I&rsquo;m proud of this group&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been targeting this game for a long time. We take inspiration from the Black Caps, and our powerplays have been excellent recently, giving us strong starts. Today, we wanted to put pressure on the bowlers, and we felt 150 was par. Getting 160 was a bonus. We know our opposition well, having played them recently, but it&rsquo;s always a big challenge facing teams like Australia.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

With India&#39;s historically dominant head-to-head record of 12-3 in T20Is, including a 5-2 lead in World Cups, the pressure is on Harmanpreet Kaur&#39;s team to maintain their supremacy despite their recent setback.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>All eyes will be on India&#39;s batting lineup, The experienced duo of Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma must provide a strong start against Pakistan&#39;s formidable bowling attack, led by captain Fatima Sana, who showcased her all-round prowess in their opening win. India&#39;s fielding woes also need immediate addressing, while Pakistan, despite their victory, face their own challenges with Diana Baig&#39;s injury potentially limiting their pace options. As both teams prepare for this 3:30 PM IST start, the match promises to be a fascinating battle between India&#39;s quest for redemption and Pakistan&#39;s aim to upset the established order.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head in T20 World Cup<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/BCCI(ICC 2024) Head to Head - 640px width (14)_1728204960.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<div><br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#27ae60\">Pakistan Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Fatima Sana | Pakistan Captain:<br />\n&quot;We&rsquo;ve chosen to bat first.

Arundhati Reddy starred for India, taking 3/19. India&#39;s chase began cautiously, losing Smriti Mandhana early. Shafali Verma (32) and Jemimah Rodrigues (23) steadied the ship with a 43-run partnership. Despite a mid-innings wobble, captain Harmanpreet Kaur&#39;s composed 29 guided India close to victory before retiring hurt. Deepti Sharma and Sajeevan Sajana finished the job, with Sajana hitting the winning boundary in the 19th over. The win gives India a perfect start to their World Cup campaign, while Pakistan must regroup quickly.

Hopefully, we&#39;ll reshuffle the batting order. I&#39;m really enjoying my time with these girls.

As a fielding unit, there&#39;s a little room for improvement, but we&#39;re happy to get our first win.&quot;Yeah, we definitely thought about it, but Shafali and I were struggling to time the ball properly. So, we tried to be calculative, ensuring we didn&#39;t lose too many wickets and put pressure on ourselves. We wanted to get over the line comfortably.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Set for October 9th at Dubai&#39;s iconic International Stadium, this match promises to be a nail-biter that could make or break either team&#39;s tournament dreams.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>India enters the fray with renewed confidence after a commanding six-wicket victory over arch-rivals Pakistan. With a 1-1 record in the tournament so far, the Women in Blue are eager to build on their momentum. The dynamic duo of Shreyanka Patil and Arundhati Reddy showcased their bowling prowess in the previous match, stifling Pakistan to a mere 105/8. The chase was then expertly navigated by the formidable batting trio of Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, and captain Harmanpreet Kaur.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>On the flip side, Sri Lanka finds itself in dire straits after two consecutive defeats. The island nation&#39;s hopes now hinge on a mathematical tightrope walk &ndash; they must not only win their remaining matches but do so convincingly while hoping for favorable results elsewhere. All eyes will be on the usually dependable batting pair of Samarawickrama and Chamari Athapaththu, who have yet to leave their mark on this tournament.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>As the tension mounts, cricket fans worldwide are curious: Which team will rise to the occasion and keep their World Cup dreams alive? Will India continue their upward trajectory, or can Sri Lanka orchestrate a stunning turnaround?</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>With both teams hungry for victory and fully aware of the consequences of defeat, we can expect a fiercely contested match filled with drama, skill, and perhaps a few surprises.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Opt to Bat first&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain: &quot;We&rsquo;ve decided to bat first. So far, we haven&rsquo;t had a chance to do that, so we&rsquo;re looking to put up a good total on the board. No matter where we go, they&rsquo;re (fans) always there to support us, and I think that&rsquo;s a real privilege. We&rsquo;re very grateful for their support, wherever we play.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000099\"><strong>Chamari Athapaththu | Sri Lanka Captain: &quot;Honestly, I feel the conditions are slow and low, but we&rsquo;re sticking to our plans and hoping to play our best cricket today. Yes, definitely, we need to be fearless during the middle overs.In the powerplay, we can take bigger risks, but after that, it&#39;s crucial to keep the scoreboard ticking by rotating the strike.

This win comes with sweet revenge, as India avenged their Asia Cup final defeat and effectively knocked Sri Lanka out of the semis race.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>It all began when India won the toss and chose to bat. Openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma put on a spectacular show, hammering 98 runs for the first wicket. Mandhana showcased her class with a solid half-century, but a moment of misfortune saw her run out immediately after. Shafali, who was striking at a run-a-ball, fell for 43 soon after. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur then took charge, smashing a rapid 50 off 27 balls, leading India to an imposing total of 172/3.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sri Lanka&#39;s chase never took off, courtesy of Renuka Singh Thakur&rsquo;s lethal new-ball bowling. She dismissed Vishmi Gunaratne for a duck, and the big blow came when Shreyanka Patil claimed the prized wicket of Chamari Athapaththu, leaving Sri Lanka reeling at 3/6 in the Powerplay. The damage was done early, and the pressure never eased. Despite a brief partnership between Kavisha Dilhari and Anushka Sanjeewani, the rest of the lineup crumbled, with Sri Lanka bowled out for 90 in 19.5 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s bowlers were in sublime form. Arundhati Reddy and Asha Sobhana each picked up three wickets, while Renuka and Shreyanka chipped in with crucial scalps. Their fielding was equally exceptional, turning half-chances into wickets and keeping the Sri Lankan batters under constant pressure.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This emphatic win not only secures India&rsquo;s second place in the group standings but also significantly boosts their Net Run Rate, inching them closer to a spot in the semifinals. The Women in Blue have sent a clear message to the rest of the tournament: they mean business!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Harmanpreet Kaur | Player of the Match:<br />\n&quot;We just aimed to keep the momentum going. Smriti and Shafali gave us the perfect start, which is exactly what we had planned. We focused on the importance of not losing wickets unnecessarily, regardless of the situation. Full credit to both of them for staying sharp and playing smart shots without taking unnecessary risks. Even after we lost two quick wickets, Jemimah and I focused on maintaining the run rate around seven to eight per over, and things just flowed from there.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000099\"><strong>Chamari Athapaththu | Sri Lanka Captain:<br />\n&quot;We really struggled with our bowling today&mdash;missed a few catches and the bowlers didn&rsquo;t get their line and length right. Even the batters didn&rsquo;t step up, so we need to go back and review what needs to be improved.Yes, the first game of the tournament is always crucial. We lost a low-scoring contest against Pakistan, which brought down the morale in the dressing room. But these things happen in cricket. We&rsquo;ve got one more game to turn things around.I&rsquo;m satisfied with my bowling performances overall, not so much today, but in the previous two games, we&rsquo;ve bowled well.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:<br />\n&quot;You always want to feel good about your performance, and today we ticked all the boxes. We batted, bowled, and fielded well, which was really satisfying. Fielding has been a focus, and it was great to take all our catches.We had discussed our targets before the game, but these tricky pitches mean you have to adapt. We lost two quick wickets, which required us to stay on our toes, but things went according to plan. We aimed for 160 and ended up with over 170, which was crucial. In situations like this, it&rsquo;s not just about winning but also improving net run rate. We need to focus on playing good cricket against Australia. Our bowlers are in rhythm, and while Australia is a tough side, we&rsquo;re delivering key breakthroughs. We just need to keep bowling well and not overthink the opposition, especially with these unpredictable wickets.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The Women in Blue, having recovered from a shaky start, are now eyeing a semi-final spot with laser focus. But a simple win won&#39;t be enough&mdash;they need to beat the defending champions by at least 61 runs to leapfrog Australia and keep their T20 dreams alive.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s dynamic duo, Harmanpreet Kaur and Smriti Mandhana, have been on fire, and they&rsquo;ll need to bring their A-game to tackle Australia&rsquo;s bowling spearheaded by the ever-dangerous Ashleigh Gardner. With the Aussies missing key players like Tayla Vlaeminck and captain Alyssa Healy nursing injuries, this could be India&#39;s golden opportunity to strike.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But there&rsquo;s more at play than just this match. If New Zealand also win their game, the battle for the semi-finals will come down to the mysterious Net Run Rate&mdash;adding even more tension to an already nerve-wracking situation.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India isn&rsquo;t just aiming to win&mdash;they&#39;re going for a victory so commanding, it&rsquo;ll make the Taj Mahal look small. Will they pull off this cricketing masterstroke and secure a spot in the final four? Or will Australia prove too tough a nut to crack? One thing&#39;s certain&mdash;this T20 showdown will have fans glued to their seats and calculators at the ready!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#16a085\">Australia Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Tahlia McGrath | Australia Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;We&#39;re going to bat first and aim to put a good total on the board.It&#39;s our third game here, so we&rsquo;ve adapted well to the conditions and are excited for today&rsquo;s match.It&#39;s play-on for now, and we&rsquo;ll focus on the important game ahead.

We&rsquo;ve made a few plans for this game, and hopefully, we can execute them well.We have the confidence to beat them, as we&rsquo;ve done it before.

India came out strong, as we expected, but I&rsquo;m really pleased we managed to get over the line.The atmosphere was intense, with most of the crowd supporting India. It was loud and challenging, but having so many fans made it special, especially in a World Cup. Our experienced players handled it well.(On Qualifying for the Semi-Finals) It&rsquo;s huge for us. Any game against India is marked on our calendars because we know it&rsquo;ll be a great contest.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;I think their entire team contributed. They didn&rsquo;t rely on just one or two players, and they have strong all-rounders. They can adapt their plans based on the situation and pitch. It&rsquo;s not that we didn&rsquo;t have plans; we did. But they didn&rsquo;t give us easy runs. They&rsquo;re definitely an experienced side, having played together in multiple World Cups, and that makes a big difference.(On Asha&#39;s injury) That&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t control. You have to manage with 13-14 players. Radha was ready to step up. She was fully involved in the game, fielded well, and gave us the breakthrough when we needed it. You need characters like her in the team.We assessed the conditions well and knew we could chase the total. When Deepti and I were batting, we missed out on capitalizing on a few loose balls. They&rsquo;re an experienced side, and we need to learn from them.We&rsquo;ve done everything within our control. If we get the chance to play another game, that would be great. If not, then the team that deserves it will move forward.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tahlia McGrath | Australia Captain:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;We knew India would be a tough opponent, and we aim to win every game, so I&rsquo;m really proud of the team for coming away with the win.(On Captaincy) As soon as Healy got injured, I knew I had to step up and lead the side. Everyone has been fantastic, backing me throughout, and I&rsquo;m really happy we got the result.The wicket started slowing down as the game went on, with the ball stopping on the surface and some keeping low. Given those conditions, we did well to post a solid total and then defend it.We were constantly discussing the par score, and the batters in the middle knew the situation. They played with freedom, and I&rsquo;m really pleased with everyone&rsquo;s contributions.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

While they&rsquo;re riding high on their recent success, the likes of Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates will find India a far tougher challenge on their home turf, where spinners like Radha Yadav can work their magic.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India already holds a spot in the 2025 ODI World Cup, and this series is the perfect stage to show their dominance and turn the tide in their favor.

The stage is set for a thrilling showdown in Ahmedabad.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report | WV Raman: &quot;The weather is perfect, with clear skies and plenty of sunshine. The pitch looks well-prepared, with a bit of grass on the surface, though it will likely dry out due to the heat. We have an exciting contest ahead between India and New Zealand, two top international sides. India have been strong in ODIs, while New Zealand has struggled in this format. There are plenty of runs to be made here, despite the average score being 207. Given the conditions, the captain winning the toss should look to bat first, build up a big total, and put pressure on the opposition.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Smriti Mandhana will be stepping in as the stand-in captain for today&#39;s match, with Harmanpreet Kaur sitting out due to a minor injury.</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div><strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India won the Toss and elected to bat&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (1)_1729759921.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</div>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The historic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad is set to come alive this Sunday as the Indian Women&rsquo;s cricket team looks to clinch the ODI series against New Zealand&rsquo;s White Ferns. Fresh off a solid win in the first match, India is just one victory away from sealing the series with an unassailable 2-0 lead in this three-match showdown.<br />\nNew Zealand, however, faces a tough challenge as they are without one of their star players&mdash;Amelia Kerr, the standout performer from the T20 World Cup&mdash;who&#39;s sidelined with a quadricep injury. On the Indian side, the focus remains on captain Harmanpreet Kaur&rsquo;s availability after she missed the series opener.<br />\nIn the first ODI, India&rsquo;s batting lineup showed depth and promise. Debutant Tajal Hasabnis led the charge with a composed 42 runs, while the reliable middle-order duo of Yastika Bhatia (37) and Deepti Sharma (41) played crucial knocks, helping India post a competitive 227 on the board. For New Zealand, the Kerr sisters were the pick of the bowlers, with Amelia grabbing 4/42 and Jess taking 3/49.<br />\nIndia&rsquo;s bowlers then put on an impressive display. Radha Yadav stood out with figures of 3/35, while another debutant, Saima Thakor, made an immediate impact by taking 2/26, including the key wicket of Suzie Bates. Despite some resistance from Georgia Plimmer (25) and Amelia Kerr (25 not out), New Zealand fell short, getting bowled out for 168.<br />\nAs the teams gear up for the second ODI, it promises to be an exciting contest between India&rsquo;s crafty spin attack and New Zealand&rsquo;s batting lineup. Both sides will be looking for stronger performances at the top of the order, with Smriti Mandhana for India and Sophie Devine for New Zealand eager to make a mark after quiet starts. The battle in the middle order, though, could ultimately tip the scales.<br />\nWith a blend of experienced players and emerging talents, India finds itself in a strong position to secure the series. Meanwhile, New Zealand will be digging deep, hoping to draw on their championship spirit to turn the tide and keep the series alive.<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report:- WV Raman</strong><br />\nWe&#39;re looking at quite a distinct surface for today&#39;s match. Unlike the previous game where we had a pure red-soil wicket, this one presents an interesting blend of red and black soil. They&#39;ve selected pitch number 6 for this encounter. The straight boundary measures 69m at its maximum, and batters should expect some variation in both bounce and pace throughout. The conditions will certainly test batting technique and adaptability.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Toss: </strong>New Zealand won the toss and decided to bat first!&nbsp;</p>\n",
        "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Powerplay (1 - 10 Overs) :</span><br />\nNZ - 46/0 (4.60 rpo, 9x4, 0x6)&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#000000\">ll </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 47/3 (4.70 rpo, 3x4, 2x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">Middle Overs (11 - 40 Overs) :</span><br />\nNZ - 133/4 (4.43 rpo, 12x4, 1x6)&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#000000\">ll </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 118/5 (3.93 rpo, 12x4, 0x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Death Overs (41 - 50 Overs) :</span><br />\nNZ - 80/5 ( 8 rpo, 10x4, 1x6)&nbsp;ll&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">IND - 18/2 (2.51 rpo, 1x4, 0x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>New Zealand Women have levelled the series 1-1 with a solid 76-run win, showcasing their depth. After losing the first match, the White Ferns bounced back impressively. Electing to bat first under the intense Ahmedabad heat, New Zealand&rsquo;s openers Georgia Plimmer and Suzie Bates laid a strong foundation with an 87-run partnership. Suzie Bates reached a well-earned half-century, scoring 58, while skipper Sophie Devine anchored the innings with a vital 79, helping New Zealand post a challenging total of 259/9. Maddy Green also played a handy knock of 42. Radha Yadav was the standout for India with her all-round performance, grabbing 4 wickets and taking three sharp catches, while Deepti Sharma, Saima Thakor, and debutant Priya Mishra also contributed with crucial breakthroughs. Chasing 260, India Women showed resilience despite an early setback of Smriti Mandhana. Although Yastika Bhatia and Shafali Verma departed for 12 and 11 respectively, the returning Harmanpreet Kaur combined with Jemimah Rodrigues to build a promising 38-run partnership. Even after their dismissals, Radha Yadav and Saima Thakor fought hard, stitching together a record 70-run stand for the 9th wicket, keeping India&rsquo;s hopes alive. Radha&rsquo;s all-round efforts and Saima&rsquo;s gritty 29 showed promise, but the team was eventually bowled out for 183 in 47.1 overs. Lea Tahuhu and Sophie Devine took 3 wickets each, with Jess Kerr and Eden Carson picking up two apiece. India can take plenty of positives from their fighting spirit and look forward to bouncing back in the series decider.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur (India Women Captain): &quot;We conceded too many runs and missed key catches, which hurt us. Despite that, with the batting lineup we have, it was still a chasable target. It was encouraging to see Radha and Saima fight towards the end. But during the chase, we kept losing wickets and struggled to build partnerships. We aimed to win, but we fell short today. Dropping their main batters and giving away easy runs cost us. It can be frustrating when Radha puts in her best effort, but we still leak boundaries. We need to improve as a unit. Like I said at the toss, these girls are committed and eager to play for the country. It&#39;s great to see them seize their chances. However, we need to work on our fielding we have to back our bowlers better. And with the bat, we need to step up and take responsibility.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Sophie Devine (Player of the match, New Zealand Captain): &quot;It was a well-rounded performance today, with contributions from everyone. We probably left 15-20 runs out there with the bat, but it&#39;s great to come away with the win. We talked a lot about building strong batting partnerships, and it was great to see Maddy Green and Izzy Gaze execute that plan well, playing with intent, taking their time initially and then attacking the bowlers. Suzie was brilliant, almost like a vintage performance is just outstanding. Losing a key player like Amelia Kerr is tough, but it makes my job easier when others step up and deliver. Now, we move to the series decider. We&rsquo;re aiming to put in a similar performance on Tuesday, staying sharp in the field and tightening things up where needed.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

The stage is set for an epic decider after India&#39;s commanding 59-run victory in the opener was countered by NZ&#39;s resilient 76-run win.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The spotlight remains on India&#39;s young sensation Tejal Hasabnis, the series&#39; leading run-scorer, while debutant Saima Thakor&#39;s pace bowling has added fresh firepower to India&#39;s attack. Radha Yadav&#39;s all-round brilliance makes her one to watch.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For the White Ferns, Sophie Devine&#39;s leadership has been exemplary - her match-winning 79 and three wickets in the second ODI showcasing her class. Despite missing Amelia Kerr, the experienced duo of Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer have stepped up admirably.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Ahmedabad pitch has offered something for everyone&mdash;batters finding value for shots while spinners extracting turns. With temperatures soaring, endurance will be key.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Can Harmanpreet&#39;s India clinch it on home soil, or will Devine&#39;s Kiwis seal a memorable away series? Don&#39;t miss this blockbuster finale!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report | WV Raman:<br />\n&quot;The decider is on Pitch 7, and conditions are bright and sunny. The dimensions are similar: 69 meters downtown, 58 square, and 53 behind. The surface is hard and dry, with 100% red soil, so we&rsquo;ll see some extra bounce. Spinners have been pivotal so far, and the middle phase will be key; the team with better shot selection will likely come out on top.&quot;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#000000\">New Zealand Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSophie Devine | New Zealand Captain:<br />\n&quot;We&rsquo;ll bat first again today. We did a great job last game, and with the pitch unlikely to change much, we&rsquo;ll look to post a solid total. (On her 150th ODI appearance) It&rsquo;s an honor, although it also means a few more warm-ups and ice packs! I&rsquo;ll reflect on the milestone later&mdash;right now, we have a job to do. The team&rsquo;s consistency has been fantastic, something I&rsquo;m proud of, and we&rsquo;ve stayed strong no matter the results. It&rsquo;s all about giving it our best on the field, and we&rsquo;ve played solidly in both games. Just one change for us: Hannah Rowe replaces Jess Kerr.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yes, we would have batted first as well. After the last game&rsquo;s defeat, we had an in-depth meeting, and the team is very positive about this match. Partnerships are key for us; we&rsquo;ve emphasized the importance of each batter building partnerships and taking responsibility to bat deep into the innings. The team is looking focused and positive for this fixture. Playing a home series always brings some added pressure, but we&rsquo;ve performed well at home, and today is another chance for us to give our best and clinch this series. We have one change: Renuka Singh Thakur comes in for Arundhati Reddy.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

After seven long weeks on the road, some well-deserved rest is finally in sight. Smriti Mandhana&rsquo;s hundred today was extraordinary. We took our cues from the World Cup, focusing on hitting the stumps&mdash;a strategy that usually works well here. Tahuhu was giving it her all, sprinting on one leg, and Melie Kerr pushed through despite her injury.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;I&#39;m really pleased with my performance tonight, especially since it helped us clinch the series. Like I mentioned after the first match, it&rsquo;s been a tough month and a half for this team. The first two games didn&rsquo;t go my way with those single-digit scores, so tonight I was really determined to make an impact for the team. My focus today was all about controlling my shots, staying disciplined, and batting through those crucial first 10 overs before building on my innings.I believe there are always different approaches, but for me, the harder way&mdash;playing for the team&mdash;is what I prefer. Every time I get out cheaply, I feel like I&#39;ve let my team down, so performing well really gives me peace of mind. As a cricketer, you experience highs and lows, but the key is to keep pushing forward.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I&rsquo;m very pleased with the result. As I mentioned this morning, we had some important discussions, and it feels great that we managed to execute our plans. Whenever we step onto the field, we aim to give 100%, even though things don&rsquo;t always go our way. As professional cricketers, it&rsquo;s essential to keep pushing forward. We emphasized this in our team meeting, so it&rsquo;s especially rewarding to come back strong after our last loss.&nbsp;I have to give credit to Smriti; she was struggling early on, but she dug deep and got the runs we needed. That was crucial, as we were determined to win this series. I&rsquo;m really happy with our partnership today.&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deepti Sharma | Player of the Series:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I always try to enjoy myself on the field and adapt to the conditions to deliver for my team. Honestly, it&rsquo;s about having confidence and trusting in my abilities. I was focused on making a strong comeback, and that self-belief really helped me perform today. I definitely work on adjusting my pace based on the conditions and the batter I&rsquo;m facing, using my skills to bowl better with each game. Moving forward, I&rsquo;ll stick to my approach but keep pushing to improve and perform even better in the matches to come.</strong></span></p>\n",

The atmosphere is charged with excitement as these two top teams clash in what promises to be an intense battle.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India arrive in Australia with renewed confidence after their 2-1 series win over New Zealand at home. However, despite their recent success, they are yet to win an ODI series against Australia on Australian soil, having lost 12 of their 16 previous encounters. The team will be eager to break this jinx and make a strong statement against the hosts.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For India, this series is not just about correcting past records but also about building momentum for the 2025 Women&#39;s ODI World Cup. With a mix of seasoned stars and promising new talent, this squad has a lot to prove. Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Deepti Sharma, who have all been in excellent form in the WBBL, will be crucial to India&rsquo;s chances. The experience of these key players, combined with the youthful energy of newcomers like Uma Chetry, Titas Sadhu, and Saima Thakor, gives India a well-rounded side that is more than capable of challenging the Aussies.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The likes of Mandhana, Rodrigues, and Sharma, who have been honing their skills in Australia through the WBBL, will be looking to use their familiarity with local conditions to their advantage. India&#39;s bowlers, including the talented Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Renuka Singh, will also play a pivotal role in containing the Australian batting order and ensuring India keeps the pressure on.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>India&rsquo;s focus will be on building partnerships, both with the bat and the ball, as they look to outsmart the Australians on their home turf. With the 2025 Women&#39;s ODI World Cup already in their sights, every series from here on is a step towards preparing for that challenge.<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat first</span></strong></p>\n",

While we didn&rsquo;t post enough runs on the board, the bowlers gave their best and fought hard, managing to take five wickets.A few of us got starts with the bat, but we couldn&rsquo;t capitalize on them. We need to focus on building better partnerships to set a stronger total. There are a few areas we need to reflect on before the next game. We had to adjust to the conditions and the pitch. We need to have a clear target in mind when batting first. We now have a better understanding of the situation and will approach the next game with a positive mindset.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tahlia McGrath | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;It was really important for us to start the series on a strong note today. My job was made easy by the exceptional bowlers the fielders, who were outstanding, and of course, Volly, who had a fantastic debut.It&rsquo;s always rewarding when the plans come together &ndash; when the bowlers execute their strategies and the fielders back them up. We did that well today, and I couldn&#39;t be happier with how everything clicked. What impressed me most was Volly&rsquo;s composure and confidence. To open the batting on debut and play shots like that right from ball one shows just how special her talent is. Chasing low totals can be tricky, but we aimed to be aggressive. The wicket looks challenging for batting, so we&rsquo;re already thinking ahead and coming up with ideas for how we can either set big totals or chase them down effectively.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

However, we ended up falling a bit short with the runs. Created some chances with our bowling but couldn&#39;t quite grab them. Have to give credit where it&#39;s due, they batted well. We need to reassess our bowling plans, as we didn&#39;t get the movement we were expecting here. Moving forward, we need to focus on batting through the full 50 overs. Got several 40s but we know we need to convert those into fifties and hundreds.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tahlia McGrath (Australia Captain)</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Look, Voll&#39;s hundred was outstanding - she just looked in complete control from the start. Those drives down the ground showed her class, and honestly, it was hard to see how they&#39;d get her out. Might have tried pushing her back but she was just too good today.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>And then there was Perry - intent clear from ball one, especially with those sixes. That&#39;s exactly what we want - taking the game on and building that platform. The whole top four executed perfectly.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>Managing the bowling was interesting - when you&#39;ve got seven options, every change becomes a real decision. We kept it simple today with short spells, mixing things up. Looking forward to the WACA - should get a bit more bounce there.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ellyse Perry (Player of the Match)<br />\n&quot;It was a completely different match compared to the last one. Really pleased with how everyone contributed through the order, giving us that solid platform. Our bowling unit showed good persistence even though the wicket wasn&#39;t offering much today. Still see room for improvement, which is exciting. We&#39;ve got such a strong lineup, and it&#39;s about everyone maximizing their role, whatever that might be on the day. The discussions around this have been positive, and everyone&#39;s embracing the challenge of taking our game forward. The way we started really set things up nicely, and it was great to be part of it.&quot;</strong></p>\n",

After two challenging matches, the visitors aim to harness their evident potential, demonstrated through Richa Ghosh&#39;s adaptability at the top order and Jemimah Rodrigues&#39; promising innings in the previous game.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The series has revealed valuable insights into India&#39;s evolution, which is particularly relevant as they prepare to host next year&#39;s World Cup. While the second ODI saw India post a respectable 249/9, with notable contributions from Harmanpreet Kaur and Rodrigues, the team recognizes the need to convert these starts into match-winning performances.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Today&#39;s match at the pace-friendly WACA offers India&#39;s lineup a crucial opportunity to fine-tune their skills. With possible adjustments in the bowling combination and Priya Punia&#39;s fitness being monitored, India looks to demonstrate their resilience and tactical acumen on this historic ground.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n",

Set a challenging target of 299 runs, India&rsquo;s chase faltered as they were bowled out for 215 in 45.1 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Australia&rsquo;s innings, led by a superb 110 from Annabel Sutherland, set the tone for the match. Contributions from Ashleigh Gardner (50), Tahlia McGrath (56 not out), and Phoebe Litchfield (25) ensured Australia posted a competitive 298/6 in their 50 overs. The innings also saw valuable partnerships, with Sutherland&#39;s brilliance guiding Australia through the middle overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In reply, India&rsquo;s top-order showed promise, with Smriti Mandhana scoring a well-made 105. However, India struggled to maintain the tempo as key wickets fell. Australia&rsquo;s bowlers, particularly Ashleigh Gardner (5 wickets for 30), took control, restricting India at crucial intervals. Despite spirited efforts from players like Mandhana and Harleen Deol, India was unable to chase down the target, finishing their innings at 215 all out.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Annabel Sutherland&nbsp; | Player of the Match &amp; Player of the Series:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\">&quot;I thought the Indian girls, especially the quick bowlers, bowled really well and picked up key wickets. Gardner and I just tried to take it deep and then capitalize when the opportunity came.Climbing up the order is never easy, but the girls have done it beautifully throughout the series. We&#39;ve had some great discussions about our approach, and it&rsquo;s really satisfying to see our plans come together and get the win.For me, it&#39;s about managing my body, especially with all the travel. It&rsquo;s important to put in the work during the pre-season and stay fit throughout the matches.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | Indian Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I think we bowled well, especially Arundhati Reddy, who was exceptional with her 10-over spell. Her performance kept us in the game.Credit goes to Australia for their impressive performances with both bat and ball throughout the series. We&rsquo;ll take a lot from these matches and analyze everything when we go back home&mdash;looking at where we went wrong and how we can improve.There were definitely positives, with Smriti&rsquo;s performance tonight being a standout. We did well in patches, but we weren&rsquo;t consistent enough. We&rsquo;ll have discussions on how to address this and focus on improving moving forward.Next, we&rsquo;re heading to Mumbai and then facing the West Indies in a home series.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tahlia McGrath | Australia Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;I&rsquo;m really happy with that performance. Ash and Belsy were outstanding with both bat and ball. They really helped shift the momentum in our favour.What&rsquo;s been most pleasing throughout this series is that someone has stepped up in different situations. We&rsquo;ve backed each other, and I&rsquo;m really excited to secure the win.For me, the batting was the real highlight. The way we played in game two, with our top four getting runs on the board, was fantastic. Belsy was also brilliant with the ball. We need to focus on our bowling execution, but overall, it&#39;s been great to finish with a win.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

After a challenging Australian tour, the hosts are eager to reset and find their rhythm in the shortest format.</p>\n\n<p>The series presents an opportunity for fresh faces in the Indian squad, with Nandini Kashyap and Raghvi Bist earning their maiden call-ups. The team&#39;s core remains strong with vice-captain Smriti Mandhana, who recently showcased her form with a century, alongside the explosive Richa Ghosh and the versatile Deepti Sharma.</p>\n\n<p>The visitors, led by the dynamic Hayley Matthews, arrive with momentum from their T20 World Cup semifinal appearance. Matthews, fresh from her WBBL heroics with Melbourne Renegades, will be crucial to their campaign. While they&#39;ll miss the experienced Stafanie Taylor, the return of Shabika Gajnabi and Rashada Williams strengthens their lineup.</p>\n\n<p>Though India holds a historical advantage in this matchup, West Indies&#39; recent T20 form makes them formidable opponents. With both teams featuring a mix of experience and emerging talent, cricket fans can expect an engaging series that could go either way.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies have won the toss and have elected to field</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Hayley Matthews, West Indies Skipper</strong>:</span>&nbsp;&quot;We are going to bowl first.

We had good net sessions and we just want to play our best brand of cricket.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur, India Skipper</strong>:</span>&nbsp;&quot;We would have also bowled first. We just want to play a good brand of cricket in this series. We have done really well, especially in India and this is our first game in India after the World Cup.&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Saima Thakor is making her debut</strong></span>.&quot;</p>\n",

India&rsquo;s top order gave a rollicking start and managed to build partnerships, with the highest partnership being 81 runs between Mandhana and Rodrigues, after which some aggressive batting in the end from Richa Ghosh and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur ensured that the Women in Blue posted a challenging total on board.</p>\n\n<p>In the chase, India picked up crucial wickets and kept the scoring in check during the Powerplay, building the initial momentum. Qiana Joseph (49 off 33 balls) and Deandra Dottin (52 off 28 balls) were the standout performers, but wickets in regular intervals, led by Deepti Sharma and Radha Yadav, ensured there was no easy way for West Indies to chase down the target, restricting them to 146/7, and securing a comfortable victory. This win gives India an early lead in the series as they look to build on their momentum.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Hayley Matthews, West Indies Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;&quot;We were probably a bit loose with the ball and also let ourselves down in the field at times. But there were some positives like Qiana striking the ball, and Dottin giving us hope. The girls have had a few days to know the conditions, and the preparation has been pretty good leading up to the series. We back ourselves to chase anything but yes they got 15-20 runs too many. There were a few massive overs that got the game away from us.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Smriti Mandhana, India Stand-in Skipper:</strong></span>&nbsp;&quot;Harmanpreet is doing fine. She is being taken care of by the medical team and hopefully will be fine soon. Uma came in and got us off to a good start, Jemi came in and continued the momentum. Credit to the bowlers with so much dew around. After winning also, we have to go back and review where we can be better. We had Sajana as our 6th bowling option but our first five bowlers did a good job. Sajana has been bowling well in the domestic games, and we have the extra option.if needed&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Jemimah Rodrigues is the Player of the Match</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Jemimah Rodrigues</span>:</strong>&nbsp;&quot;Really happy. More happy that we won the game. It has been a lot of cricket lately and it is challenging to keep yourself mentally fresh. I spoke to Smriti recently and I am happy that I could execute the plans. The plan was to get to 200, we could have pushed a little bit, we know what West Indies and Dottin can do, but the bowlers did a fine job in restricting them.&quot;</p>\n",

West Indies&#39; strategy demands sharper execution, particularly in the powerplay where India&#39;s dynamic top order has proven formidable.The Navi Mumbai evening conditions could play kingmaker, with the surface traditionally offering something for both batters and bowlers. The toss might prove crucial, as teams navigate the dew factor under lights.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This encounter transcends mere statistics &ndash; it&#39;s about West Indies&#39; resilience against India&#39;s home dominance. Matthews&#39; tactical acumen will be tested against India&#39;s well-oiled machinery, while the hosts aim to maintain their aggressive brand of cricket that&#39;s rapidly becoming their hallmark in T20Is.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Smriti Mandhana Will Captain the Women in Blue today&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies Won the toss and Elected to Bowl&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nHayley Matthews | West Indies Captain:<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"> &quot;We&#39;ll bowl first as conditions favor chasing.

However, our bowling unit performed exceptionally last game, and we&#39;re confident about defending again today.

We needed to be more sensible and could have scored 10-15 additional runs as a batting unit. We&#39;ll take this defeat and learn from it.While dew wasn&rsquo;t a significant factor in the first 10 overs of their bowling, we know it will play a role later on. As a team, we need to prepare better for such conditions. We&#39;ll practice under wet conditions and hopefully return stronger in the next match.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayley Matthews | West Indies Captain &amp; Player of the Match:</strong> <span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We realized we didn&#39;t perform our best in the previous game, but today the team came prepared and the result was clear. We assessed the score at the halfway point and recognized that Smriti batted exceptionally well. Kudos to players like Deandra and others who stepped up and bowled effectively during the latter part of the first innings.We were pleased with scoring 160 and knew that with strong batting and building partnerships, we could chase it down. &quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Each team enters this clash having notched a commanding victory, setting the stage for a gripping contest.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana, stepping in seamlessly for Harmanpreet Kaur, has impressed with consecutive half-centuries, providing class and assurance at the top. The rest of India&rsquo;s batting lineup, brimming with promise and skill, will look to build around her solid starts. In the bowling department, Titas Sadhu and Radha Yadav have shown spark, while experienced campaigners like Renuka Singh Thakur and Deepti Sharma are eager to hit their stride under the spotlight. Familiar conditions and passionate home support could further bolster India&rsquo;s challenge.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For the West Indies, Hayley Matthews remains the fulcrum. Her unbeaten 85 in the previous match underscored her status among cricket&rsquo;s finest all-rounders. With Henry and Fletcher offering variety and bite, the visitors boast an attack capable of challenging India&rsquo;s confident stroke-makers. Tighter fielding will only enhance their advantage.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>All told, this finale promises a showcase of talent, temperament, and tension&mdash;an ideal finale for a captivating series.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies Won the Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayley Matthews | West Indies Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;re quite fortunate this series and will opt to bowl first again.

As an allrounder, Aaliyah adds depth to our batting lineup.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana&nbsp; | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We would have preferred to bowl first, but the toss isn&rsquo;t in our control. We need to bat well and put up a strong total. With dew around, anything above 185 should be good, and we&rsquo;re ready to do whatever it takes to secure a win.We have a very young team filled with fresh faces.

Captain Smriti Mandhana once again led from the front, registering her third consecutive fifty of the series, displaying remarkable consistency and class at the crease. The rest of the batting lineup well supported Mandhana&rsquo;s fluent stroke play, as they built partnerships and kept the momentum high. Later in the innings, Richa Ghosh provided the ideal finish, hammering a blistering fifty off just 21 deliveries, taking India&rsquo;s total beyond the visitors&rsquo; reach.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing an imposing target of 218, West Indies struggled to find their footing. They lost wickets at regular intervals and never truly challenged India&rsquo;s bowlers. Radha Yadav stood out with the ball, claiming four crucial wickets to derail the chase. Although Deandra Dottin and Chinelle Henry offered brief resistance, their efforts proved insufficient against a well-disciplined Indian attack that maintained pressure throughout ending West Indies innings at 157/9.<br />\n<br />\nHayley Matthews : (West Indies Captain)</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;We had a tough night with the ball, honestly.

While our batting continues to show promise, our bowling discipline let us down tonight. Some players didn&#39;t meet expectations, but there are still positives we can build on looking forward.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Richa Ghosh : (Player of The Match)</strong><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Smriti and Raghvi perfectly set the platform, but I just wanted to keep that momentum going. When I see deliveries in my zone, I back myself to clear the ropes, doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s ball one or the last ball, that&#39;s my natural game.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I practice exactly like this in the nets - it&#39;s all about executing what I train for. Getting this opportunity felt great, and even better that I could deliver for the team when it mattered.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Smriti Mandhana: (India Captain and Player of The Series)</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Breaking our five-year home series drought feels special - it finally reflects the cricket we&#39;re capable of playing. With three young talents in our lineup, I knew I had to shoulder more responsibility. It wasn&#39;t just about timing the ball well, but about leading from the front, especially after losing every toss.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Harman&#39;s absence in the middle order was significant - she&#39;s our backbone there. But I&#39;m proud of how everyone stepped up. Raghvi showing such courage, hitting that six so early in her career - that&#39;s something special. And Richa, what a performer! She was incredible today, took the game away completely. This win is about the entire team rising to the occasion.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The action shifts to Vadodara&#39;s Kotambi Stadium as India Women take on West Indies Women in the first of three ODIs on Sunday. Fresh from their record-breaking T20I performance, the hosts will look to bounce back in the 50-over format after a recent setback in Australia.India&#39;s squad sees some fresh faces with Tanuja Kanwar and Pratika Rawal earning maiden call-ups. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur, who missed the latter part of the T20I series, is expected to return, joining the in-form Smriti Mandhana to strengthen the batting lineup.For West Indies, the series carries extra significance as they chase World Cup qualification points. Currently ninth in the rankings, they need four wins from their remaining six matches to secure automatic qualification. The return of powerhouse Deandra Dottin to ODIs after nearly two years significantly boosts their chances.The visitors, led by the dynamic Hayley Matthews, will be eager to improve upon their previous ODI outing in India, where they faced a whitewash eight years ago. With both teams showing similar win rates in ODIs this year and the Kotambi Stadium pitch being relatively untested, the series opener promises an intriguing battle between two well-matched sides.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">West Indies Won the Toss and Elected to Field</span></strong></p>\n\n<div><br />\n&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div><strong>Pitch Report by WV Raman:&nbsp;The conditions at the BCA stadium are excellent. The outfield is lush and well-maintained. The weather is pleasant, and the pitch appears in great shape. The longest boundary measures 69 metres, with square boundaries at 59 metres and 52 metres behind the square. The pitch, made of black soil, is well-rolled, firm, and has a touch of grass. It promises good bounce, giving batters a great chance to score runs. The ball should come nicely onto the bat, setting the stage for a high-scoring game.</strong></div>\n",

Despite Zaida James&#39;s impressive five-wicket haul (5/45) for the visitors, India&#39;s batting depth proved too much to handle.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The West Indies chase crumbled under the brilliance of Renuka Singh Thakur, who recorded her career-best figures of 5/29. Her new-ball spell set the tone as she dismantled the top order with precise swing bowling. Only Afy Fletcher showed some resistance with an unbeaten 24, but it was far from enough as the visitors were bundled out for 103 in 26.2 overs. The emphatic win gives India a 1-0 lead in the three-match series&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayley Matthews | West Indies Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, we probably weren&#39;t on the mark today. Obviously, all three phases of the game went against us, and this isn&#39;t the kind of cricket we want to play.I think we need to get back to the training ground, improve, and work harder. We&#39;ll have off days like this, and we need to try and bounce back from these situations.We were aiming for around 270-280, but we didn&#39;t finish well with the ball. Also, if we field better, it will definitely save us a few more runs.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I must credit our physio team; I&#39;ve been battling a knee issue for a while. Thanks to Rajni sir, our physio, and our fielding coach for their support. I&#39;m happy with how things are shaping up.Smriti&#39;s batting may look effortless, but it&#39;s far from easy. Renuka has been fantastic for years, and today&#39;s five-wicket haul was extra special. It&#39;s great to see how well we&#39;ve been fielding, both in the previous series. I&#39;m pleased with our approach. Playing in India is enjoyable. The facilities are top-notch, and we enjoy performing at home. The pitches and grounds are wonderful.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Renuka Singh Thakur | Player of the Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;The team really motivates me. Harman asked if I wanted to bowl, and my confidence grew with each wicket. We focused on spot bowling for ODIs and worked on single-wicket deliveries. Jhulan Goswami also shared valuable tips. It&rsquo;s tough for bowlers since lines and lengths differ from T20s, but practice helps us deliver. Whatever we prepare for, that&rsquo;s what we execute on the field.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

        "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>India will look to seal the series against West Indies in the second ODI at Vadodara&rsquo;s Kotambi Stadium. The hosts delivered a masterclass in the opener, crushing the visitors by 211 runs. Batting first, India posted a formidable 314/9, thanks to Smriti Mandhana&rsquo;s brilliant 91 and a strong debut by Pratika Rawal, who scored 40. Contributions from Harleen Deol and Jemimah Rodrigues added to India&rsquo;s dominance. Zaida James shone for the visitors, picking up a maiden five-wicket haul, but the lack of support from her teammates and poor fielding let West Indies down. In response, Renuka Singh Thakur dismantled the Windies with her maiden ODI five-for as the visitors folded for just 103. West Indies&rsquo; batting collapsed under pressure, with only Afy Fletcher showing some resistance. Heading into the second ODI, West Indies must regroup quickly, particularly in batting and fielding, to stay alive in the series. Meanwhile, India, riding high on confidence, will aim to replicate their all-round performance and secure a comprehensive series victory.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report | WV Raman:</strong><br />\n<strong>&quot;Conditions are fantastic as we&rsquo;ve shifted from pitch 6 to pitch 7. The square boundaries are 58 meters, and it&rsquo;s 69 meters down the ground. The surface appears slightly drier with less grass, making it ideal for batting. Bowlers will need to stick to straighter lines to find success. Overall, it&rsquo;s a batting-friendly pitch, but crafty bowlers can still make an impact&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> India Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We are going to bat first.

We need to focus on bowling better, restricting them, and picking up crucial wickets.This series is extremely important for us, especially with those two World Cup qualification points at stake. We&rsquo;ll take tomorrow to rest, enjoy Christmas, and then get back to work.&nbsp;It was a bittersweet moment.

The way our bowlers were bowling, I had the trust that we will win this game. We leaked a few runs but Deepti came back into the attack and took the big wicket. Really happy with the performance.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harleen Deol | Player Of The Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;&quot;Definitely, a proud moment for me. Enjoying it. Actually when I came into bat, I had much time. I knew the more I play, the more shots I play, that is what was on my mind.&nbsp;When you are batting well, you are batting well, there is nothing special in it.&nbsp;Definitely, it means a lot to me. Scoring the century was special and the ultimate goal was to make my team win.&nbsp;For me, it is the first one. I don&#39;t know about the scrappy ones. For me, one or two shots did not come off. My partners told me not to go for them and I listened to them.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

All-rounder Orla Prendergast&#39;s performance in subcontinental conditions could prove crucial, while wicketkeeper Joanna Loughran replaces the injured Amy Hunter.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The series carries ICC Women&#39;s Championship implications, particularly for Ireland, which needs qualifier points for the 2025 World Cup.

Captain Gaby Lewis anchored the innings with a patient 92 off 129 balls, supported by Leah Paul&rsquo;s fluent 59. However, tight bowling from India, particularly by Priya Mishra (2/56) and Deepti Sharma (1/41), kept the Irish scoring in check.India&#39;s response was led by an explosive start from captain Smriti Mandhana, who struck a blistering 41 off 29 balls. Pratika Rawal then took charge with a superb 89 off 96 deliveries, combining steadiness with flair. Tejal Hasabnis provided the finishing touches with an unbeaten 53 off 46 balls, ensuring a smooth chase.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gaby Lewis | Ireland Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, I&rsquo;m feeling good. Just a cramp, but it&rsquo;s fine now. There are definitely positives to take from this match&mdash;we&rsquo;ve improved a lot compared to how we played in Bangladesh.I&rsquo;m delighted with the effort. Credit to Leah as well; after we lost a few quick wickets, she batted brilliantly. Transitioning from the conditions in Bangladesh, where the wickets were so different, this was a solid performance. I&rsquo;m proud of the team.I&rsquo;m particularly pleased with the fielding and the way our spinners bowled. We had a discussion about those areas, and it&rsquo;s great to see improvement game by game. That&rsquo;s the kind of progress&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana | India Captain:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;To bowl on this kind of wicket, which didn&rsquo;t offer much, our young bowlers did a commendable job. And in batting, the way Pratika and Tejal finished things off was exceptional.You need to understand your bowlers&#39; strengths, and their execution of slower balls and bouncers was key on this pitch. While we&rsquo;re happy with the win, we would&rsquo;ve loved to restrict them to around 180.There&rsquo;s a lot of preparation behind the scenes, and that will be crucial in the next 7-8 months. People see what happens on the field, but our work off the field is equally important.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pratika Rawal&nbsp; | Player Of The Match:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;Yeah, I think so. I feel comfortable here; it helps a lot. I always enjoy the kind of shots Smriti plays&mdash;it really eases the nerves.We were just trying to keep it simple. Starting at 67 without loss gave us a great platform, and we built on that momentum. Everyone chipped in and made their mark.Honestly, no. I just focus on doing what I do best without worrying too much about the result. If the ball is in my slot, I go for my shots; otherwise, I just look for singles.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Jemimah Rodrigues played a scintillating knock, scoring her maiden ODI century, while Smriti Mandhana, Pratika Rawal, and Harleen Deol made valuable contributions, each scoring fifties. The Indian batting line-up found boundaries effortlessly, putting Ireland on the backfoot right from the start.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, Ireland struggled to chase down the daunting target of 371. Regular wickets fell, and although keeper-batter Coulter Rally showed resilience with a brilliant 80-run innings, it wasn&rsquo;t enough. India&rsquo;s bowlers dominated, with Deepti Sharma picking up three wickets and Priya Mishra contributing with two crucial breakthroughs. Despite a late fight, Ireland finished at 254/7, handing India a comprehensive victory and a 2-0 lead in the series.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gaby Lewis:&nbsp; Ireland Captain</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&quot;There are still plenty of positives to take from this game. We managed to put up a better total than the last match, and it&rsquo;s encouraging to see different players stepping up in different games.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Christina showed real fearlessness out there, and it&rsquo;s a testament to the hard work of the coaching staff. They&rsquo;ve been doing a fantastic job, and it&rsquo;s great to see that reflected in our performances.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana:&nbsp; India&nbsp; Captain</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;We won the toss and chose to bat, and I&rsquo;m really happy with the overall performance. Jemi, Pratika, and Harleen played brilliantly to get us to 370. The fielding unit also put in a great effort, which was very pleasing to see.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>It&rsquo;s a new partnership with Pratika, and I&rsquo;m delighted to have her at the other end. She has a mature head on her shoulders, and together we focus on taking singles and doubles, which has been key to our three 100-run partnerships.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>This is a World Cup year, and I&rsquo;m especially excited about our new bowling unit. While they are new at the international level, they&rsquo;ve been standout strike bowlers in domestic cricket and bring plenty of variations to the table. It&rsquo;s a blessing to have them in the side, and I&rsquo;m confident they&rsquo;ll continue to deliver.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jemimah Rodrigues: Player of The Match</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I&rsquo;m relieved to get runs under my belt. I&rsquo;ve scored a lot in domestic cricket, but the roles here have been different, especially since I&rsquo;ve played more T20s. I tried to stick to the way I play in the domestic circuit, but adapting to this format has taken some time.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I usually bat at No. 5, so patience is key. It&rsquo;s about hitting the gaps and keeping the scoreboard ticking. We had a clear plan to bat till the 40th over, and when I was taking my time, my partner stepped up and took charge.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We&rsquo;ve played a lot of cricket together, even if not always batting together, and that understanding really helped us build a strong partnership.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

As hosts, India has dominated the series, winning the first two games convincingly, and now seeks to complete a clean sweep. The team has displayed remarkable consistency, with different players rising to the occasion in crucial moments.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Pratika Rawal has been a standout performer, smashing two fifties in as many games, while skipper Smriti Mandhana, Harleen Deol, and Jemimah Rodrigues have also delivered key contributions with the bat.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Ireland, on the other hand, will aim to avoid a whitewash and secure valuable Championship points. Their batting unit has shown potential with multiple contributors, but their bowling attack has yet to pose a significant challenge to the formidable Indian lineup. A determined effort will be required for Ireland to turn the tide in the final game.<br />\n<br />\nToss Update:- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">India won the toss and opted to bat first!&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nSmriti Mandhana:-</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;We don&#39;t have a target in mind, just want to see how it goes. A lot of game time for the batters. I am really happy that everyone has the game time. You have to be vocal [as captain]. We have two changes&nbsp;</span><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Saima Thakor and Priya Mishra have been rested, Tanuja Kanwar and Minnu Mani come in.&quot;</span><br />\n<br />\nGaby Lewis:-</strong><br />\n&quot;<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>We would have chosen to bat as well.

Batting first, India unleashed a batting masterclass, amassing their highest-ever ODI total of 435/5 in 50 overs. Pratika Rawal starred with a sensational maiden century, scoring 154 runs in a stunning display of stroke play. Captain Smriti Mandhana added to the carnage with her 10th ODI century, anchoring the innings with elegance.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In the final overs, Harleen Deol and Richa Ghosh provided fireworks, propelling India to a mammoth total. Ireland&#39;s bowlers struggled to contain the onslaught, with no bowler managing to make a significant impact.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing an improbable target of 436, Ireland faltered early and never recovered. Orla Prendergast and Sarah Forbes showed resilience with the bat putting up a 64-run stand for the third wicket, but their efforts were insufficient against India&#39;s disciplined bowling attack. Ireland was eventually bowled out for 131 losing their last seven wickets for just 31 runs, falling well short of the target.<br />\n<br />\nGaby Lewis (Ireland Captain)</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s been the first time playing in India for a few of our players, and the experience has been fantastic&mdash;the atmosphere, the people, and the noise have all been amazing. There&rsquo;s been a lot to learn, especially coming up against world-class players. The team put on a great show today, and it was really exciting to watch.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;(</strong></span><strong>On Qualifiers Game Plan): -</strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Our focus will be on consistency with both bat and ball. There are plenty of positives to take from this series. Different players stepped up at different times, which highlights the depth we have in the group. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll aim to build on as we move forward.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pratika Rawal (Player of The Match and Series)</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;It&rsquo;s a great start to the January season, and I&rsquo;m very happy with how things have gone. It&rsquo;s always special to score runs, but doing it for the country means so much more&mdash;it&rsquo;s definitely a confidence booster. I&rsquo;m really happy with my performance throughout the series.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I had the celebration in my mind&mdash;the moment I kiss the helmet&mdash;and I was visualizing that as I approached the milestone. It was something I really wanted to do, and it felt amazing to finally execute it.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Watching Smriti bat is such a treat&mdash;it all looks so easy when she&rsquo;s at the crease. I don&rsquo;t mind taking a backseat when she&rsquo;s batting because it&rsquo;s just incredible to watch her in action.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Smriti Mandhana (India Captain)</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&quot;I am really pleased that all the girls got game time. The centuries and fifties from the batters have been fantastic. I&rsquo;m especially happy for Jemi, Harleen, Pratika, and Richa&mdash;they&rsquo;ve all contributed brilliantly. The bowlers also executed the plans perfectly, which was great to see.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Except for my dropped catch, I&rsquo;d say it was a near-perfect game. Winning the toss, choosing to bat, and scoring 400+ was a huge positive. The way Richa and Pratika batted was outstanding, and the bowlers finishing things off in the 31st over was superb.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>It was a planned approach. I was just thinking, there aren&rsquo;t many matches where you get the chance to go out and attack freely, so I decided to try a few shots. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. Fortunately, today it did.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>There&rsquo;s plenty to work on. As much as we want to enjoy this victory, we need to stay focused and prepare for the World Cup. Fielding and running between the wickets will be critical over the course of 50 overs&mdash;those 300 balls are where we can make a real difference. If we can excel in these two areas, we have the potential to do something special.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
